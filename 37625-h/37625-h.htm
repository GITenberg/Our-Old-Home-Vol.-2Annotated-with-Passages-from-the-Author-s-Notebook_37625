<h2>OUR OLD HOME</h2>

<hr class="chapter">

<p class="h3">NEAR OXFORD</p>

<p>On a fine morning in September we set
out on an excursion to Blenheim,&mdash;the
sculptor and myself being seated on the
box of our four-horse carriage, two more of
the party in the dicky, and the others less
agreeably accommodated inside. We had
no coachman, but two postilions in short
scarlet jackets and leather breeches with
top-boots, each astride of a horse; so that,
all the way along, when not otherwise attracted,
we had the interesting spectacle of
their up-and-down bobbing in the saddle.
It was a sunny and beautiful day, a specimen
of the perfect English weather, just
warm enough for comfort,&mdash;indeed, a little
too warm, perhaps, in the noontide sun,&mdash;yet
retaining a mere spice or suspicion
of austerity, which made it all the more
enjoyable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The country between Oxford and Blenheim
is not particularly interesting, being
almost level, or undulating very slightly;
nor is Oxfordshire, agriculturally, a rich
part of England. We saw one or two
hamlets, and I especially remember a picturesque
old gabled house at a turnpike
gate, and, altogether, the wayside scenery
had an aspect of old-fashioned English life;
but there was nothing very memorable till
we reached Woodstock, and stopped to
water our horses at the Black Bear. This
neighborhood is called New Woodstock,
but has by no means the brand-new appearance
of an American town, being a large
village of stone houses, most of them pretty
well time-worn and weather-stained. The
Black Bear is an ancient inn, large and
respectable, with balustraded staircases, and
intricate passages and corridors, and queer
old pictures and engravings hanging in the
entries and apartments. We ordered a
lunch (the most delightful of English institutions,
next to dinner) to be ready against
our return, and then resumed our drive to
Blenheim.</p>

<p>The park gate of Blenheim stands close
to the end of the village street of Woodstock.
Immediately on passing through its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
portals we saw the stately palace in the
distance, but made a wide circuit of the
park before approaching it. This noble
park contains three thousand acres of land,
and is fourteen miles in circumference.
Having been, in part, a royal domain before
it was granted to the Marlborough family,
it contains many trees of unsurpassed antiquity,
and has doubtless been the haunt
of game and deer for centuries. We saw
pheasants in abundance, feeding in the
open lawns and glades; and the stags
tossed their antlers and bounded away, not
affrighted, but only shy and gamesome, as
we drove by. It is a magnificent pleasure-ground,
not too tamely kept, nor rigidly
subjected within rule, but vast enough to
have lapsed back into nature again, after
all the pains that the landscape-gardeners
of Queen Anne's time bestowed on it, when
the domain of Blenheim was scientifically
laid out. The great, knotted, slanting
trunks of the old oaks do not now look as
if man had much intermeddled with their
growth and postures. The trees of later
date, that were set out in the Great Duke's
time, are arranged on the plan of the order
of battle in which the illustrious commander
ranked his troops at Blenheim; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
ground covered is so extensive, and the
trees now so luxuriant, that the spectator
is not disagreeably conscious of their standing
in military array, as if Orpheus had
summoned them together by beat of drum.
The effect must have been very formal a
hundred and fifty years ago, but has ceased
to be so,&mdash;although the trees, I presume,
have kept their ranks with even more fidelity
than Marlborough's veterans did.</p>

<p>One of the park-keepers, on horseback,
rode beside our carriage, pointing out the
choice views, and glimpses at the palace, as
we drove through the domain. There is a
very large artificial lake (to say the truth,
it seemed to me fully worthy of being compared
with the Welsh lakes, at least, if not
with those of Westmoreland), which was
created by Capability Brown, and fills the
basin that he scooped for it, just as if Nature
had poured these broad waters into
one of her own valleys. It is a most beautiful
object at a distance, and not less so on
its immediate banks; for the water is very
pure, being supplied by a small river, of the
choicest transparency, which was turned
thitherward for the purpose. And Blenheim
owes not merely this water scenery,
but almost all its other beauties, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
contrivance of man. Its natural features
are not striking; but Art has effected such
wonderful things that the uninstructed visitor
would never guess that nearly the whole
scene was but the embodied thought of
a human mind. A skillful painter hardly
does more for his blank sheet of canvas
than the landscape-gardener, the planter,
the arranger of trees, has done for the
monotonous surface of Blenheim,&mdash;making
the most of every undulation,&mdash;flinging
down a hillock, a big lump of earth out of
a giant's hand, wherever it was needed,&mdash;putting
in beauty as often as there was a
niche for it,&mdash;opening vistas to every
point that deserved to be seen, and throwing
a veil of impenetrable foliage around
what ought to be hidden;&mdash;and then, to
be sure, the lapse of a century has softened
the harsh outline of man's labors, and has
given the place back to Nature again with
the addition of what consummate science
could achieve.</p>

<p>After driving a good way, we came to
a battlemented tower and adjoining house,
which used to be the residence of the
Ranger of Woodstock Park, who held
charge of the property for the King before
the Duke of Marlborough possessed it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
The keeper opened the door for us, and in
the entrance-hall we found various things
that had to do with the chase and woodland
sports. We mounted the staircase,
through several stories, up to the top of
the tower, whence there was a view of the
spires of Oxford, and of points much farther
off,&mdash;very indistinctly seen, however,
as is usually the case with the misty
distances of England. Returning to the
ground-floor, we were ushered into the
room in which died Wilmot, the wicked
Earl of Rochester, who was Ranger of the
Park in Charles II.'s time. It is a low
and bare little room, with a window in front,
and a smaller one behind; and in the contiguous
entrance-room there are the remains
of an old bedstead, beneath the canopy
of which, perhaps, Rochester may have
made the penitent end that Bishop Burnet
attributes to him. I hardly know what it
is, in this poor fellow's character, which
affects us with greater tenderness on his
behalf than for all the other profligates of
his day, who seem to have been neither
better nor worse than himself. I rather
suspect that he had a human heart which
never quite died out of him, and the warmth
of which is still faintly perceptible amid
the dissolute trash which he left behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Methinks, if such good fortune ever befell
a bookish man, I should choose this
lodge for my own residence, with the top-most
room of the tower for a study, and all
the seclusion of cultivated wildness beneath
to ramble in. There being no such possibility,
we drove on, catching glimpses of
the palace in new points of view, and by
and by came to Rosamond's Well. The particular
tradition that connects Fair Rosamond
with it is not now in my memory;
but if Rosamond ever lived and loved, and
ever had her abode in the maze of Woodstock,
it may well be believed that she and
Henry sometimes sat beside this spring.
It gushes out from a bank, through some
old stone-work, and dashes its little cascade
(about as abundant as one might turn out
of a large pitcher) into a pool, whence it
steals away towards the lake, which is not
far removed. The water is exceedingly
cold, and as pure as the legendary Rosamond
was not, and is fancied to possess medicinal
virtues, like springs at which saints
have quenched their thirst. There were
two or three old women and some children
in attendance with tumblers, which they
present to visitors, full of the consecrated
water; but most of us filled the tumblers
for ourselves, and drank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Thence we drove to the Triumphal Pillar
which was erected in honor of the Great
Duke, and on the summit of which he
stands, in a Roman garb, holding a winged
figure of Victory in his hand, as an ordinary
man might hold a bird. The column
is I know not how many feet high, but
lofty enough, at any rate, to elevate Marlborough
far above the rest of the world,
and to be visible a long way off; and it is
so placed in reference to other objects,
that, wherever the hero wandered about
his grounds, and especially as he issued
from his mansion, he must inevitably have
been reminded of his glory. In truth, until
I came to Blenheim, I never had so positive
and material an idea of what Fame
really is&mdash;of what the admiration of his
country can do for a successful warrior&mdash;as
I carry away with me and shall always
retain. Unless he had the moral force
of a thousand men together, his egotism
(beholding himself everywhere, imbuing
the entire soil, growing in the woods,
rippling and gleaming in the water, and
pervading the very air with his greatness)
must have been swollen within him like
the liver of a Strasburg goose. On the
huge tablets inlaid into the pedestal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the column, the entire Act of Parliament,
bestowing Blenheim on the Duke of Marlborough
and his posterity, is engraved in
deep letters, painted black on the marble
ground. The pillar stands exactly a mile
from the principal front of the palace, in a
straight line with the precise centre of its
entrance-hall; so that, as already said, it
was the Duke's principal object of contemplation.</p>

<p>We now proceeded to the palace-gate,
which is a great pillared archway, of wonderful
loftiness and state, giving admittance
into a spacious quadrangle. A stout,
elderly, and rather surly footman in livery
appeared at the entrance, and took possession
of whatever canes, umbrellas, and parasols
he could get hold of, in order to
claim sixpence on our departure. This
had a somewhat ludicrous effect. There is
much public outcry against the meanness
of the present Duke in his arrangements
for the admission of visitors (chiefly, of
course, his native countrymen) to view the
magnificent palace which their forefathers
bestowed upon his own. In many cases,
it seems hard that a private abode should
be exposed to the intrusion of the public
merely because the proprietor has inherited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
or created a splendor which attracts general
curiosity; insomuch that his home
loses its sanctity and seclusion for the
very reason that it is better than other
men's houses. But in the case of Blenheim,
the public have certainly an equitable
claim to admission, both because the
fame of its first inhabitant is a national
possession, and because the mansion was
a national gift, one of the purposes of
which was to be a token of gratitude and
glory to the English people themselves.
If a man chooses to be illustrious, he is
very likely to incur some little inconveniences
himself, and entail them on his posterity.
Nevertheless, his present Grace
of Marlborough absolutely ignores the public
claim above suggested, and (with a
thrift of which even the hero of Blenheim
himself did not set the example) sells
tickets admitting six persons at ten shillings;
if only one person enters the gate,
he must pay for six; and if there are seven
in company, two tickets are required to
admit them. The attendants, who meet
you everywhere in the park and palace,
expect fees on their own private account,&mdash;their
noble master pocketing the ten
shillings. But, to be sure, the visitor gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
his money's worth, since it buys him the
right to speak just as freely of the Duke
of Marlborough as if he were the keeper
of the Cremorne Gardens.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Passing through a gateway on the opposite
side of the quadrangle, we had before
us the noble classic front of the palace,
with its two projecting wings. We
ascended the lofty steps of the portal, and
were admitted into the entrance-hall, the
height of which, from floor to ceiling, is
not much less than seventy feet, being the
entire elevation of the edifice. The hall
is lighted by windows in the upper story,
and, it being a clear, bright day, was very
radiant with lofty sunshine, amid which a
swallow was flitting to and fro. The ceiling
was painted by Sir James Thornhill in some
allegorical design (doubtless commemorative
of Marlborough's victories), the purport
of which I did not take the trouble
to make out,&mdash;contenting myself with the
general effect, which was most splendidly
and effectively ornamental.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The above was written two or three years ago, or
more; and the Duke of that day has since transmitted
his coronet to his successor, who, we understand, has
adopted much more liberal arrangements. There is
seldom anything to criticise or complain of, as regards
the facility of obtaining admission to interesting private
houses in England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p></div>

<p>We were guided through the show-rooms
by a very civil person, who allowed us to
take pretty much our own time in looking
at the pictures. The collection is exceedingly
valuable,&mdash;many of these works of
Art having been presented to the Great
Duke by the crowned heads of England or
the Continent. One room was all aglow
with pictures by Rubens; and there were
works of Raphael, and many other famous
painters, any one of which would be sufficient
to illustrate the meanest house that
might contain it. I remember none of
them, however (not being in a picture-seeing
mood), so well as Vandyck's large and
familiar picture of Charles I. on horseback,
with a figure and face of melancholy dignity
such as never by any other hand was
put on canvas. Yet, on considering this
face of Charles (which I find often repeated
in half-lengths) and translating it from the
ideal into literalism, I doubt whether the
unfortunate king was really a handsome
or impressive-looking man: a high, thin-ridged
nose, a meagre, hatchet face, and
reddish hair and beard,&mdash;these are the literal
facts. It is the painter's art that has
thrown such pensive and shadowy grace
around him.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>

<p>On our passage through this beautiful
suite of apartments, we saw, through the
vista of open doorways, a boy of ten or
twelve years old coming towards us from
the farther rooms. He had on a straw
hat, a linen sack that had certainly been
washed and rewashed for a summer or
two, and gray trousers a good deal worn,&mdash;a
dress, in short, which an American
mother in middle station would have
thought too shabby for her darling schoolboy's
ordinary wear. This urchin's face
was rather pale (as those of English children
are apt to be, quite as often as our
own), but he had pleasant eyes, an intelligent
look, and an agreeable boyish manner.
It was Lord Sunderland, grandson of the
present Duke, and heir&mdash;though not, I
think, in the direct line&mdash;of the blood of
the great Marlborough, and of the title and
estate.</p>

<p>After passing through the first suite of
rooms, we were conducted through a corresponding
suite on the opposite side of the
entrance-hall. These latter apartments
are most richly adorned with tapestries,
wrought and presented to the first Duke
by a sisterhood of Flemish nuns; they look
like great, glowing pictures, and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
cover the walls of the rooms. The designs
purport to represent the Duke's battles
and sieges; and everywhere we see the
hero himself, as large as life, and as gorgeous
in scarlet and gold as the holy sisters
could make him, with a three-cornered hat
and flowing wig, reining in his horse, and
extending his leading-staff in the attitude
of command. Next to Marlborough, Prince
Eugene is the most prominent figure. In
the way of upholstery, there can never have
been anything more magnificent than these
tapestries; and, considered as works of Art,
they have quite as much merit as nine pictures
out of ten.</p>

<p>One whole wing of the palace is occupied
by the library, a most noble room, with a
vast perspective length from end to end.
Its atmosphere is brighter and more cheerful
than that of most libraries: a wonderful
contrast to the old college libraries of Oxford,
and perhaps less sombre and suggestive
of thoughtfulness than any large library
ought to be; inasmuch as so many studious
brains as have left their deposit on
the shelves cannot have conspired without
producing a very serious and ponderous
result. Both walls and ceiling are white,
and there are elaborate doorways and fireplaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of white marble. The floor is of
oak, so highly polished that our feet slipped
upon it as if it had been New England ice.
At one end of the room stands a statue
of Queen Anne in her royal robes, which
are so admirably designed and exquisitely
wrought that the spectator certainly gets
a strong conception of her royal dignity;
while the face of the statue, fleshy and
feeble, doubtless conveys a suitable idea of
her personal character.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The marble of
this work, long as it has stood there, is as
white as snow just fallen, and must have
required most faithful and religious care to
keep it so. As for the volumes of the
library, they are wired within the cases,
and turn their gilded backs upon the visitor,
keeping their treasures of wit and
wisdom just as intangible as if still in the
unwrought mines of human thought.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In front of St. Paul's there is a statue of Queen
Anne, which looks rather more majestic, I doubt not,
than that fat old dame ever did.&mdash;II. 97.</p></div>

<p>I remember nothing else in the palace,
except the chapel, to which we were conducted
last, and where we saw a splendid
monument to the first Duke and Duchess,
sculptured by Rysbrach, at the cost, it is
said, of forty thousand pounds. The de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>sign
includes the statues of the deceased
dignitaries, and various allegorical flourishes,
fantasies, and confusions; and beneath
sleep the great Duke and his proud
wife, their veritable bones and dust, and
probably all the Marlboroughs that have
since died. It is not quite a comfortable
idea that these mouldy ancestors still inhabit,
after their fashion, the house where
their successors spend the passing day; but
the adulation lavished upon the hero of
Blenheim could not have been consummated,
unless the palace of his lifetime had
become likewise a stately mausoleum over
his remains,&mdash;and such we felt it all to be,
after gazing at his tomb.</p>

<p>The next business was to see the private
gardens. An old Scotch under-gardener
admitted us and led the way, and seemed
to have a fair prospect of earning the fee
all by himself; but by and by another respectable
Scotchman made his appearance
and took us in charge, proving to be the
head-gardener in person. He was extremely
intelligent and agreeable, talking
both scientifically and lovingly about trees
and plants, of which there is every variety
capable of English cultivation. Positively,
the Garden of Eden cannot have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
more beautiful than this private garden of
Blenheim. It contains three hundred acres,
and by the artful circumlocution of the
paths, and the undulations, and the skillfully
interposed clumps of trees, is made to appear
limitless. The sylvan delights of a
whole country are compressed into this
space, as whole fields of Persian roses go
to the concoction of an ounce of precious
attar. The world within that garden-fence
is not the same weary and dusty world
with which we outside mortals are conversant;
it is a finer, lovelier, more harmonious
Nature; and the Great Mother lends herself
kindly to the gardener's will, knowing
that he will make evident the half-obliterated
traits of her pristine and ideal beauty,
and allow her to take all the credit and
praise to herself. I doubt whether there
is ever any winter within that precinct,&mdash;any
clouds, except the fleecy ones of summer.
The sunshine that I saw there rests
upon my recollection of it as if it were
eternal. The lawns and glades are like
the memory of places where one has wandered
when first in love.</p>

<p>What a good and happy life might be
spent in a paradise like this! And yet, at
that very moment, the besotted Duke (ah!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I have let out a secret which I meant to
keep to myself; but the ten shillings must
pay for all) was in that very garden (for
the guide told us so, and cautioned our
young people not to be too uproarious),
and, if in a condition for arithmetic, was
thinking of nothing nobler than how many
ten-shilling tickets had that day been sold.
Republican as I am, I should still love to
think that noblemen lead noble lives, and
that all this stately and beautiful environment
may serve to elevate them a little
way above the rest of us. If it fail to
do so, the disgrace falls equally upon the
whole race of mortals as on themselves;
because it proves that no more favorable
conditions of existence would eradicate our
vices and weaknesses. How sad, if this be
so! Even a herd of swine, eating the
acorns under those magnificent oaks of
Blenheim, would be cleanlier and of better
habits than ordinary swine.</p>

<p>Well, all that I have written is pitifully
meagre, as a description of Blenheim; and
I hate to leave it without some more adequate
expression of the noble edifice, with
its rich domain, all as I saw them in that
beautiful sunshine; for, if a day had been
chosen out of a hundred years, it could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
have been a finer one. But I must give
up the attempt; only further remarking
that the finest trees here were cedars, of
which I saw one&mdash;and there may have
been many such&mdash;immense in girth, and
not less than three centuries old. I likewise
saw a vast heap of laurel, two hundred
feet in circumference, all growing from one
root; and the gardener offered to show us
another growth of twice that stupendous
size. If the Great Duke himself had been
buried in that spot, his heroic heart could
not have been the seed of a more plentiful
crop of laurels.</p>

<p>We now went back to the Black Bear,
and sat down to a cold collation, of which
we ate abundantly, and drank (in the good
old English fashion) a due proportion of
various delightful liquors. A stranger in
England, in his rambles to various quarters
of the country, may learn little in regard
to wines (for the ordinary English taste is
simple, though sound, in that particular),
but he makes acquaintance with more varieties
of hop and malt liquor than he previously
supposed to exist. I remember a
sort of foaming stuff, called hop-champagne,
which is very vivacious, and appears
to be a hybrid between ale and bottled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
cider. Another excellent tipple for warm
weather is concocted by mixing brown-stout
or bitter ale with ginger-beer, the foam of
which stirs up the heavier liquor from its
depths, forming a compound of singular
vivacity and sufficient body. But of all
things ever brewed from malt (unless it be
the Trinity Ale of Cambridge, which I
drank long afterwards, and which Barry
Cornwall has celebrated in immortal verse),
commend me to the Archdeacon, as the
Oxford scholars call it, in honor of the
jovial dignitary who first taught these erudite
worthies how to brew their favorite
nectar. John Barleycorn has given his
very heart to this admirable liquor; it is
a superior kind of ale, the Prince of Ales,
with a richer flavor and a mightier spirit
than you can find elsewhere in this weary
world. Much have we been strengthened
and encouraged by the potent blood of the
Archdeacon!</p>

<p>A few days after our excursion to Blenheim,
the same party set forth, in two flies,
on a tour to some other places of interest
in the neighborhood of Oxford. It was
again a delightful day; and, in truth, every
day, of late, had been so pleasant that it
seemed as if each must be the very last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
such perfect weather; and yet the long
succession had given us confidence in as
many more to come. The climate of England
has been shamefully maligned, its sulkiness
and asperities are not nearly so
offensive as Englishmen tell us (their climate
being the only attribute of their country
which they never overvalue); and the
really good summer-weather is the very
kindest and sweetest that the world knows.</p>

<p>We first drove to the village of Cumnor,
about six miles from Oxford, and alighted
at the entrance of the church. Here, while
waiting for the keys, we looked at an old
wall of the churchyard, piled up of loose
gray stones, which are said to have once
formed a portion of Cumnor Hall, celebrated
in Mickle's ballad and Scott's romance.
The hall must have been in very
close vicinity to the church,&mdash;not more
than twenty yards off; and I waded through
the long, dewy grass of the churchyard,
and tried to peep over the wall, in hopes
to discover some tangible and traceable
remains of the edifice. But the wall was
just too high to be overlooked, and difficult
to clamber over without tumbling down
some of the stones; so I took the word of
one of our party, who had been here before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that there is nothing interesting on
the other side. The churchyard is in rather
a neglected state, and seems not to have
been mown for the benefit of the parson's
cow; it contains a good many gravestones,
of which I remember only some upright
memorials of slate to individuals of the
name of Tabbs.</p>

<p>Soon a woman arrived with the key of
the church-door, and we entered the simple
old edifice, which has the pavement of lettered
tombstones, the sturdy pillars and low
arches, and other ordinary characteristics
of an English country church. One or two
pews, probably those of the gentle folk of
the neighborhood, were better furnished
than the rest, but all in a modest style.
Near the high altar, in the holiest place,
there is an oblong, angular, ponderous
tomb of blue marble, built against the wall,
and surmounted by a carved canopy of the
same material; and over the tomb, and
beneath the canopy, are two monumental
brasses, such as we oftener see inlaid into
a church pavement. On these brasses are
engraved the figures of a gentleman in
armor, and a lady in an antique garb, each
about a foot high, devoutly kneeling in
prayer; and there is a long Latin inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
likewise cut into the enduring brass,
bestowing the highest eulogies on the
character of Anthony Forster, who, with
his virtuous dame, lies buried beneath this
tombstone. His is the knightly figure that
kneels above; and if Sir Walter Scott
ever saw this tomb, he must have had an
even greater than common disbelief in
laudatory epitaphs, to venture on depicting
Anthony Forster in such hues as blacken
him in the romance. For my part, I read
the inscription in full faith, and believe
the poor deceased gentleman to be a much-wronged
individual, with good grounds for
bringing an action of slander in the courts
above.</p>

<p>But the circumstance, lightly as we treat
it, has its serious moral. What nonsense
it is, this anxiety, which so worries us
about our good fame, or our bad fame,
after death! If it were of the slightest
real moment, our reputations would have
been placed by Providence more in our
own power, and less in other people's, than
we now find them to be. If poor Anthony
Forster happens to have met Sir Walter
in the other world, I doubt whether he has
ever thought it worth while to complain of
the latter's misrepresentations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>We did not remain long in the church,
as it contains nothing else of interest;
and, driving through the village, we passed
a pretty large and rather antique-looking
inn, bearing the sign of the Bear and
Ragged Staff. It could not be so old, however,
by at least a hundred years, as Giles
Gosling's time; nor is there any other object
to remind the visitor of the Elizabethan
age, unless it be a few ancient cottages,
that are perhaps of still earlier date.
Cumnor is not nearly so large a village,
nor a place of such mark, as one anticipates
from its romantic and legendary
fame; but, being still inaccessible by railway,
it has retained more of a sylvan character
than we often find in English country
towns. In this retired neighborhood
the road is narrow and bordered with
grass, and sometimes interrupted by gates;
the hedges grow in unpruned luxuriance;
there is not that close-shaven neatness and
trimness that characterize the ordinary
English landscape. The whole scene conveys
the idea of seclusion and remoteness.
We met no travelers, whether on foot or
otherwise.</p>

<p>I cannot very distinctly trace out this
day's peregrinations; but, after leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Cumnor a few miles behind us, I think we
came to a ferry over the Thames, where
an old woman served as ferryman, and
pulled a boat across by means of a rope
stretching from shore to shore. Our two
vehicles being thus placed on the other
side, we resumed our drive,&mdash;first glancing,
however, at the old woman's antique
cottage, with its stone floor, and the circular
settle round the kitchen fireplace,
which was quite in the medi&aelig;val English
style.</p>

<p>We next stopped at Stanton Harcourt,
where we were received at the parsonage
with a hospitality which we should take
delight in describing, if it were allowable
to make public acknowledgment of the private
and personal kindnesses which we
never failed to find ready for our needs.
An American in an English house will
soon adopt the opinion that the English
are the very kindest people on earth, and
will retain that idea as long, at least, as
he remains on the inner side of the threshold.
Their magnetism is of a kind that
repels strongly while you keep beyond a
certain limit, but attracts as forcibly if you
get within the magic line.</p>

<p>It was at this place, if I remember right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
that I heard a gentleman ask a friend of
mine whether he was the author of "The
Red Letter A;" and, after some consideration
(for he did not seem to recognize
his own book, at first, under this improved
title), our countryman responded doubtfully,
that he believed so. The gentleman
proceeded to inquire whether our friend
had spent much time in America,&mdash;evidently
thinking that he must have been
caught young, and have had a tincture of
English breeding, at least, if not birth, to
speak the language so tolerably, and appear
so much like other people. This insular
narrowness is exceedingly queer, and
of very frequent occurrence, and is quite
as much a characteristic of men of education
and culture as of clowns.</p>

<p>Stanton Harcourt is a very curious old
place. It was formerly the seat of the ancient
family of Harcourt, which now has
its principal abode at Nuneham Courtney,
a few miles off. The parsonage is a relic
of the family mansion, or castle, other portions
of which are close at hand; for,
across the garden, rise two gray towers,
both of them picturesquely venerable, and
interesting for more than their antiquity.
One of these towers, in its entire capacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
from height to depth, constituted the
kitchen of the ancient castle, and is still
used for domestic purposes, although it
has not, nor ever had, a chimney; or, we
might rather say, it is itself one vast chimney,
with a hearth of thirty feet square,
and a flue and aperture of the same size.
There are two huge fireplaces within, and
the interior walls of the tower are blackened
with the smoke that for centuries
used to gush forth from them, and climb
upward, seeking an exit through some wide
air-holes in the conical roof, full seventy
feet above. These lofty openings were
capable of being so arranged, with reference
to the wind, that the cooks are said to have
been seldom troubled by the smoke; and
here, no doubt, they were accustomed to
roast oxen whole, with as little fuss and
ado as a modern cook would roast a fowl.
The inside of the tower is very dim and
sombre (being nothing but rough stone
walls, lighted only from the apertures above
mentioned), and has still a pungent odor
of smoke and soot, the reminiscence of
the fires and feasts of generations that
have passed away. Methinks the extremest
range of domestic economy lies between
an American cooking-stove and the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
kitchen, seventy dizzy feet in height and
all one fireplace, of Stanton Harcourt.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;the place being without a parallel
in England, and therefore necessarily beyond
the experience of an American&mdash;it
is somewhat remarkable that, while we
stood gazing at this kitchen, I was haunted
and perplexed by an idea that somewhere
or other I had seen just this strange spectacle
before. The height, the blackness,
the dismal void, before my eyes, seemed as
familiar as the decorous neatness of my
grandmother's kitchen; only my unaccountable
memory of the scene was lighted
up with an image of lurid fires blazing all
round the dim interior circuit of the tower.
I had never before had so pertinacious an
attack, as I could not but suppose it, of
that odd state of mind wherein we fitfully
and teasingly remember some previous
scene or incident, of which the one now
passing appears to be but the echo and
reduplication. Though the explanation of
the mystery did not for some time occur
to me, I may as well conclude the matter
here. In a letter of Pope's, addressed
to the Duke of Buckingham, there is an
account of Stanton Harcourt (as I now
find, although the name is not mentioned),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
where he resided while translating a part
of the "Iliad." It is one of the most admirable
pieces of description in the language,&mdash;playful
and picturesque, with fine
touches of humorous pathos,&mdash;and conveys
as perfect a picture as ever was drawn
of a decayed English country-house; and
among other rooms, most of which have
since crumbled down and disappeared, he
dashes off the grim aspect of this kitchen,&mdash;which,
moreover, he peoples with witches,
engaging Satan himself as head cook, who
stirs the infernal caldrons that seethe and
bubble over the fires. This letter, and
others relative to his abode here, were very
familiar to my earlier reading, and, remaining
still fresh at the bottom of my memory,
caused the weird and ghostly sensation
that came over me on beholding the real
spectacle that had formerly been made so
vivid to my imagination.</p>

<p>Our next visit was to the church, which
stands close by, and is quite as ancient as
the remnants of the castle. In a chapel
or side aisle, dedicated to the Harcourts,
are found some very interesting family
monuments,&mdash;and among them, recumbent
on a tombstone, the figure of an armed
knight of the Lancastrian party, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
slain in the Wars of the Roses. His features,
dress, and armor are painted in colors,
still wonderfully fresh, and there still
blushes the symbol of the Red Rose, denoting
the faction for which he fought and
died. His head rests on a marble or alabaster
helmet; and on the tomb lies the
veritable helmet, it is to be presumed,
which he wore in battle,&mdash;a ponderous
iron case, with the visor complete, and
remnants of the gilding that once covered
it. The crest is a large peacock, not of
metal, but of wood. Very possibly, this
helmet was but an heraldic adornment of
his tomb; and, indeed, it seems strange
that it has not been stolen before now, especially
in Cromwell's time, when knightly
tombs were little respected, and when armor
was in request. However, it is needless
to dispute with the dead knight about
the identity of his iron pot, and we may as
well allow it to be the very same that so
often gave him the headache in his lifetime.
Leaning against the wall, at the foot
of the tomb, is the shaft of a spear, with a
wofully tattered and utterly faded banner
appended to it,&mdash;the knightly banner beneath
which he marshaled his followers in
the field. As it was absolutely falling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
pieces, I tore off one little bit, no bigger
than a finger-nail, and put it into my waistcoat
pocket; but seeking it subsequently,
it was not to be found.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the little chapel,
two or three yards from this tomb, is another
monument, on which lie, side by side,
one of the same knightly race of Harcourts
and his lady. The tradition of the family
is, that this knight was the standard-bearer
of Henry of Richmond in the Battle of
Bosworth Field; and a banner, supposed
to be the same that he carried, now droops
over his effigy. It is just such a colorless
silk rag as the one already described. The
knight has the order of the Garter on his
knee, and the lady wears it on her left
arm,&mdash;an odd place enough for a garter;
but, if worn in its proper locality, it could
not be decorously visible. The complete
preservation and good condition of these
statues, even to the minutest adornment
of the sculpture, and their very noses,&mdash;the
most vulnerable part of a marble man,
as of a living one,&mdash;are miraculous. Except
in Westminster Abbey, among the
chapels of the kings, I have seen none so
well preserved. Perhaps they owe it to
the loyalty of Oxfordshire, diffused throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
its neighborhood by the influence of
the University, during the great Civil War
and the rule of the Parliament. It speaks
well, too, for the upright and kindly character
of this old family, that the peasantry,
among whom they had lived for ages, did
not desecrate their tombs, when it might
have been done with impunity.</p>

<p>There are other and more recent memorials
of the Harcourts, one of which is the
tomb of the last lord, who died about a
hundred years ago. His figure, like those
of his ancestors, lies on the top of his tomb,
clad, not in armor, but in his robes as a
peer. The title is now extinct, but the
family survives in a younger branch, and
still holds this patrimonial estate, though
they have long since quitted it as a residence.</p>

<p>We next went to see the ancient fishponds
appertaining to the mansion, and
which used to be of vast dietary importance
to the family in Catholic times, and when
fish was not otherwise attainable. There
are two or three, or more, of these reservoirs,
one of which is of very respectable
size,&mdash;large enough, indeed, to be really
a picturesque object, with its grass-green
borders, and the trees drooping over it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the towers of the castle and the church
reflected within the weed-grown depths of
its smooth mirror. A sweet fragrance, as
it were, of ancient time and present quiet
and seclusion was breathing all around;
the sunshine of to-day had a mellow charm
of antiquity in its brightness. These
ponds are said still to breed abundance of
such fish as love deep and quiet waters;
but I saw only some minnows, and one or
two snakes, which were lying among the
weeds on the top of the water, sunning and
bathing themselves at once.</p>

<p>I mentioned that there were two towers
remaining of the old castle: the one containing
the kitchen we have already visited;
the other, still more interesting, is next to
be described. It is some seventy feet high,
gray and reverend, but in excellent repair,
though I could not perceive that anything
had been done to renovate it. The basement
story was once the family chapel, and
is, of course, still a consecrated spot. At
one corner of the tower is a circular turret,
within which a narrow staircase, with worn
steps of stone, winds round and round as
it climbs upward, giving access to a chamber
on each floor, and finally emerging on
the battlemented roof. Ascending this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
turret stair, and arriving at the third story,
we entered a chamber, not large, though
occupying the whole area of the tower, and
lighted by a window on each side. It was
wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark
oak, and had a little fireplace in one of the
corners. The window-panes were small
and set in lead. The curiosity of this
room is, that it was once the residence of
Pope, and that he here wrote a considerable
part of the translation of Homer, and likewise,
no doubt, the admirable letters to
which I have referred above. The room
once contained a record by himself,
scratched with a diamond on one of the
window-panes (since removed for safekeeping
to Nuneham Courtney, where it
was shown me), purporting that he had
here finished the fifth book of the "Iliad"
on such a day.</p>

<p>A poet has a fragrance about him, such
as no other human being is gifted withal;
it is indestructible, and clings forevermore
to everything that he has touched. I was
not impressed, at Blenheim, with any sense
that the mighty Duke still haunted the
palace that was created for him; but here,
after a century and a half, we are still
conscious of the presence of that decrepit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
little figure of Queen Anne's time, although
he was merely a casual guest in the old
tower, during one or two summer months.
However brief the time and slight the
connection, his spirit cannot be exorcised
so long as the tower stands. In my mind,
moreover, Pope, or any other person with
an available claim, is right in adhering to
the spot, dead or alive; for I never saw a
chamber that I should like better to inhabit,&mdash;so
comfortably small, in such a
safe and inaccessible seclusion, and with a
varied landscape from each window. One
of them looks upon the church, close at
hand, and down into the green churchyard,
extending almost to the foot of the tower;
the others have views wide and far, over a
gently undulating tract of country. If
desirous of a loftier elevation, about a
dozen more steps of the turret stair will
bring the occupant to the summit of the
tower,&mdash;where Pope used to come, no
doubt, in the summer evenings, and peep&mdash;poor
little shrimp that he was!&mdash;through
the embrasures of the battlement.</p>

<p>From Stanton Harcourt we drove&mdash;I
forget how far&mdash;to a point where a boat
was waiting for us upon the Thames, or
some other stream; for I am ashamed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
confess my ignorance of the precise geographical
whereabout. We were, at any
rate, some miles above Oxford, and, I should
imagine, pretty near one of the sources of
England's mighty river. It was little more
than wide enough for the boat, with extended
oars, to pass,&mdash;shallow, too, and
bordered with bulrushes and water-weeds,
which, in some places, quite overgrew the
surface of the river from bank to bank.
The shores were flat and meadow-like, and
sometimes, the boatman told us, are overflowed
by the rise of the stream. The
water looked clean and pure, but not particularly
transparent, though enough so to
show us that the bottom is very much
weed-grown; and I was told that the weed
is an American production, brought to
England with importations of timber, and
now threatening to choke up the Thames
and other English rivers. I wonder it does
not try its obstructive powers upon the
Merrimack, the Connecticut, or the Hudson,&mdash;not
to speak of the St. Lawrence or
the Mississippi!</p>

<p>It was an open boat, with cushioned
seats astern, comfortably accommodating
our party; the day continued sunny and
warm, and perfectly still; the boatman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
well trained to his business, managed the
oars skillfully and vigorously: and we went
down the stream quite as swiftly as it was
desirable to go, the scene being so pleasant,
and the passing hours so thoroughly
agreeable. The river grew a little wider
and deeper, perhaps, as we glided on, but
was still an inconsiderable stream: for it
had a good deal more than a hundred miles
to meander through before it should bear
fleets on its bosom, and reflect palaces and
towers and Parliament houses and dingy
and sordid piles of various structure, as it
rolled to and fro with the tide, dividing
London asunder. Not, in truth, that I ever
saw any edifice whatever reflected in its
turbid breast, when the sylvan stream, as
we beheld it now, is swollen into the
Thames at London.</p>

<p>Once, on our voyage, we had to land,
while the boatman and some other persons
drew our skiff round some rapids, which
we could not otherwise have passed; another
time, the boat went through a lock.
We, meanwhile, stepped ashore to examine
the ruins of the old nunnery of Godstowe,
where Fair Rosamond secluded herself,
after being separated from her royal lover.
There is a long line of ruinous wall, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
shattered tower at one of the angles; the
whole much ivy-grown,&mdash;brimming over,
indeed, with clustering ivy, which is rooted
inside of the walls. The nunnery is now,
I believe, held in lease by the city of Oxford,
which has converted its precincts into
a barnyard. The gate was under lock and
key, so that we could merely look at the
outside, and soon resumed our places in
the boat.</p>

<p class="caption">The Thames, from Folly Bridge.</p>

<p>At three o'clock or thereabouts (or
sooner or later,&mdash;for I took little heed of
time, and only wished that these delightful
wanderings might last forever) we reached
Folly Bridge, at Oxford. Here we took possession
of a spacious barge, with a house in
it, and a comfortable dining-room or drawing-room
within the house, and a level roof,
on which we could sit at ease, or dance if
so inclined. These barges are common at
Oxford,&mdash;some very splendid ones being
owned by the students of the different colleges,
or by clubs. They are drawn by
horses, like canal-boats; and a horse being
attached to our own barge, he trotted
off at a reasonable pace, and we slipped
through the water behind him, with a
gentle and pleasant motion, which, save
for the constant vicissitude of cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
scenery, was like no motion at all. It was
life without the trouble of living; nothing
was ever more quietly agreeable. In this
happy state of mind and body we gazed at
Christ Church meadows, as we passed,
and at the receding spires and towers of
Oxford, and on a good deal of pleasant variety
along the banks: young men rowing
or fishing; troops of naked boys bathing,
as if this were Arcadia, in the simplicity
of the Golden Age; country-houses, cottages,
water-side inns, all with something
fresh about them, as not being sprinkled
with the dust of the highway. We were a
large party now; for a number of additional
guests had joined us at Folly Bridge,
and we comprised poets, novelists, scholars,
sculptors, painters, architects, men and
women of renown, dear friends, genial, outspoken,
open-hearted Englishmen,&mdash;all
voyaging onward together, like the wise
ones of Gotham in a bowl. I remember
not a single annoyance, except, indeed,
that a swarm of wasps came aboard of us
and alighted on the head of one of our
young gentlemen, attracted by the scent of
the pomatum which he had been rubbing
into his hair. He was the only victim, and
his small trouble the one little flaw in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
day's felicity, to put us in mind that we
were mortal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a table had been laid in the
interior of our barge, and spread with cold
ham, cold fowl, cold pigeon-pie, cold beef,
and other substantial cheer, such as the
English love, and Yankees too,&mdash;besides
tarts, and cakes, and pears, and plums,&mdash;not
forgetting, of course, a goodly provision
of port, sherry, and champagne, and
bitter ale, which is like mother's milk to
an Englishman, and soon grows equally
acceptable to his American cousin. By the
time these matters had been properly attended
to, we had arrived at that part of
the Thames which passes by Nuneham
Courtney, a fine estate belonging to the
Harcourts, and the present residence of
the family. Here we landed, and, climbing
a steep slope from the river-side,
paused a moment or two to look at an architectural
object, called the Carfax, the
purport of which I do not well understand.
Thence we proceeded onward, through the
loveliest park and woodland scenery I ever
saw, and under as beautiful a declining
sunshine as heaven ever shed over earth,
to the stately mansion-house.</p>

<p>As we here cross a private threshold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
it is not allowable to pursue my feeble narrative
of this delightful day with the same
freedom as heretofore; so, perhaps, I may
as well bring it to a close. I may mention,
however, that I saw the library, a fine,
large apartment, hung round with portraits
of eminent literary men, principally of the
last century, most of whom were familiar
guests of the Harcourts. The house itself
is about eighty years old, and is built
in the classic style, as if the family had been
anxious to diverge as far as possible from
the Gothic picturesqueness of their old
abode at Stanton Harcourt. The grounds
were laid out in part by Capability Brown,
and seemed to me even more beautiful
than those of Blenheim. Mason the poet,
a friend of the house, gave the design of a
portion of the garden. Of the whole place
I will not be niggardly of my rude Transatlantic
praise, but be bold to say that it
appeared to me as perfect as anything
earthly can be,&mdash;utterly and entirely finished,
as if the years and generations had
done all that the hearts and minds of the
successive owners could contrive for a spot
they dearly loved. Such homes as Nuneham
Courtney are among the splendid
results of long hereditary possession; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
we Republicans, whose households melt
away like new-fallen snow in a spring morning,
must content ourselves with our many
counterbalancing advantages,&mdash;for this
one, so apparently desirable to the far-projecting
selfishness of our nature, we are
certain never to attain.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, nevertheless,
that Nuneham Courtney is one of the great
show-places of England. It is merely a
fair specimen of the better class of country-seats,
and has a hundred rivals, and
many superiors, in the features of beauty,
and expansive, manifold, redundant comfort,
which most impressed me. A moderate
man might be content with such a
home,&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>And now I take leave of Oxford without
even an attempt to describe it,&mdash;there being
no literary faculty, attainable or conceivable
by me, which can avail to put it
adequately, or even tolerably, upon paper.
It must remain its own sole expression;
and those whose sad fortune it may be
never to behold it have no better resource
than to dream about gray, weather-stained,
ivy-grown edifices, wrought with quaint
Gothic ornament, and standing around
grassy quadrangles, where cloistered walks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>have echoed to the quiet footsteps of
twenty generations,&mdash;lawns and gardens
of luxurious repose, shadowed with canopies
of foliage, and lit up with sunny
glimpses through archways of great boughs,&mdash;spires,
towers, and turrets, each with its
history and legend,&mdash;dimly magnificent
chapels, with painted windows of rare
beauty and brilliantly diversified hues,
creating an atmosphere of richest gloom,&mdash;vast
college halls, high-windowed, oaken-paneled,
and hung round with portraits of
the men, in every age, whom the university
has nurtured to be illustrious,&mdash;long
vistas of alcoved libraries, where the wisdom
and learned folly of all time is shelved,&mdash;kitchens
(we throw in this feature by
way of ballast, and because it would not be
English Oxford without its beef and beer),
with huge fireplaces, capable of roasting a
hundred joints at once,&mdash;and cavernous
cellars, where rows of piled-up hogsheads
seethe and fume with that mighty malt-liquor
which is the true milk of Alma
Mater: make all these things vivid in your
dream, and you will never know nor believe
how inadequate is the result to represent
even the merest outside of Oxford.</p>

<p>We feel a genuine reluctance to conclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
this article without making our grateful
acknowledgments, by name, to a gentleman
whose overflowing kindness was the main
condition of all our sight-seeings and enjoyments.
Delightful as will always be our
recollection of Oxford and its neighborhood,
we partly suspect that it owes much of
its happy coloring to the genial medium
through which the objects were presented
to us,&mdash;to the kindly magic of a hospitality
unsurpassed, within our experience, in the
quality of making the guest contented with
his host, with himself, and everything about
him. He has inseparably mingled his image
with our remembrance of the Spires of
Oxford.</p>

<p class="h3">SOME OF THE HAUNTS OF BURNS</p>

<p>We left Carlisle at a little past eleven,
and within the half hour were at Gretna
Green. Thence we rushed onward into
Scotland through a flat and dreary tract of
country, consisting mainly of desert and
bog, where probably the moss-troopers were
accustomed to take refuge after their raids
into England. Anon, however, the hills
hove themselves up to view, occasionally
attaining a height which might almost be
called mountainous. In about two hours
we reached Dumfries, and alighted at the
station there.</p>

<p>Chill as the Scottish summer is reputed
to be, we found it an awfully hot day, not
a whit less so than the day before; but we
sturdily adventured through the burning
sunshine up into the town, inquiring our
way to the residence of Burns. The street
leading from the station is called Shakespeare
Street; and at its farther extremity
we read "Burns Street" on a corner-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>&mdash;the
avenue thus designated having been
formerly known as "Mill-Hole Brae." It
is a vile lane, paved with small, hard stones
from side to side, and bordered by cottages
or mean houses of whitewashed stone, joining
one to another along the whole length
of the street. With not a tree, of course,
or a blade of grass between the paving-stones,
the narrow lane was as hot as
Tophet, and reeked with a genuine Scotch
odor, being infested with unwashed children,
and altogether in a state of chronic
filth; although some women seemed to be
hopelessly scrubbing the thresholds of their
wretched dwellings. I never saw an outskirt
of a town less fit for a poet's residence,
or in which it would be more miserable for
any man of cleanly predilections to spend
his days.</p>

<p>We asked for Burns's dwelling; and a
woman pointed across the street to a two-story
house, built of stone, and whitewashed,
like its neighbors, but perhaps of a
little more respectable aspect than most of
them, though I hesitate in saying so. It
was not a separate structure, but under the
same continuous roof with the next. There
was an inscription on the door, bearing no
reference to Burns, but indicating that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
house was now occupied by a ragged or
industrial school. On knocking, we were
instantly admitted by a servant-girl, who
smiled intelligently when we told our errand,
and showed us into a low and very
plain parlor, not more than twelve or fifteen
feet square. A young woman, who seemed
to be a teacher in the school, soon appeared,
and told us that this had been
Burns's usual sitting-room, and that he had
written many of his songs here.</p>

<p>She then led us up a narrow staircase
into a little bedchamber over the parlor.
Connecting with it, there is a very small
room, or windowed closet, which Burns
used as a study; and the bedchamber itself
was the one where he slept in his later
lifetime, and in which he died at last.
Altogether, it is an exceedingly unsuitable
place for a pastoral and rural poet to live
or die in,&mdash;even more unsatisfactory than
Shakespeare's house, which has a certain
homely picturesqueness that contrasts favorably
with the suburban sordidness of
the abode before us. The narrow lane,
the paving-stones, and the contiguity of
wretched hovels are depressing to remember;
and the steam of them (such is our
human weakness) might almost make the
poet's memory less fragrant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>As already observed, it was an intolerably
hot day. After leaving the house,
we found our way into the principal street
of the town, which, it may be fair to say, is
of very different aspect from the wretched
outskirt above described. Entering a hotel
(in which, as a Dumfries guide-book assured
us, Prince Charles Edward had once
spent a night), we rested and refreshed
ourselves, and then set forth in quest of
the mausoleum of Burns.</p>

<p>Coming to St. Michael's Church, we saw
a man digging a grave, and, scrambling out
of the hole, he let us into the churchyard,
which was crowded full of monuments.
Their general shape and construction are
peculiar to Scotland, being a perpendicular
tablet of marble or other stone, within a
framework of the same material, somewhat
resembling the frame of a looking-glass;
and, all over the churchyard, these sepulchral
memorials rise to the height of ten,
fifteen, or twenty feet, forming quite an
imposing collection of monuments, but inscribed
with names of small general significance.
It was easy, indeed, to ascertain
the rank of those who slept below; for in
Scotland it is the custom to put the occupation
of the buried personage (as "Skinner,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
"Shoemaker," "Flesher") on his
tombstone. As another peculiarity, wives
are buried under their maiden names, instead
of those of their husbands, thus giving
a disagreeable impression that the married
pair have bidden each other an eternal
farewell on the edge of the grave.</p>

<p>There was a foot-path through this crowded
churchyard, sufficiently well worn to
guide us to the grave of Burns; but a
woman followed behind us, who, it appeared
kept the key of the mausoleum,
and was privileged to show it to strangers.
The monument is a sort of Grecian temple,
with pilasters and a dome, covering a space
of about twenty feet square. It was formerly
open to all the inclemencies of the
Scotch atmosphere, but is now protected
and shut in by large squares of rough
glass, each pane being of the size of one
whole side of the structure. The woman
unlocked the door, and admitted us into
the interior. Inlaid into the floor of the
mausoleum is the gravestone of Burns,&mdash;the
very same that was laid over his grave
by Jean Armour, before this monument
was built. Displayed against the surrounding
wall is a marble statue of Burns at the
plough, with the Genius of Caledonia summoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the ploughman to turn poet. Methought
it was not a very successful piece
of work; for the plough was better sculptured
than the man, and the man, though
heavy and cloddish, was more effective
than the goddess. Our guide informed us
that an old man of ninety, who knew
Burns, certifies this statue to be very like
the original.</p>

<p>The bones of the poet, and of Jean
Armour, and of some of their children, lie
in the vault over which we stood. Our guide
(who was intelligent, in her own plain way,
and very agreeable to talk withal) said
that the vault was opened about three
weeks ago, on occasion of the burial of
the eldest son of Burns. The poet's bones
were disturbed, and the dry skull, once so
brimming over with powerful thought and
bright and tender fantasies, was taken
away, and kept for several days by a Dumfries
doctor. It has since been deposited
in a new leaden coffin, and restored to the
vault. We learned that there is a surviving
daughter of Burns's eldest son, and
daughters likewise of the two younger
sons,&mdash;and, besides these, an illegitimate
posterity by the eldest son, who appears
to have been of disreputable life in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
younger days. He inherited his father's
failings, with some faint shadow, I have
also understood, of the great qualities
which have made the world tender of his
father's vices and weaknesses.</p>

<p>We listened readily enough to this paltry
gossip, but found that it robbed the poet's
memory of some of the reverence that was
its due. Indeed, this talk over his grave
had very much the same tendency and effect
as the home-scene of his life, which
we had been visiting just previously. Beholding
his poor, mean dwelling and its
surroundings, and picturing his outward
life and earthly manifestations from these,
one does not so much wonder that the
people of that day should have failed to
recognize all that was admirable and immortal
in a disreputable, drunken, shabbily
clothed, and shabbily housed man, consorting
with associates of damaged character,
and, as his only ostensible occupation,
gauging the whiskey, which he too often
tasted. Siding with Burns, as we needs
must, in his plea against the world, let us
try to do the world a little justice too. It
is far easier to know and honor a poet
when his fame has taken shape in the
spotlessness of marble than when the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
man comes staggering before you, besmeared
with the sordid stains of his daily
life. For my part, I chiefly wonder that
his recognition dawned so brightly while
he was still living. There must have been
something very grand in his immediate
presence, some strangely impressive characteristic
in his natural behavior, to have
caused him to seem like a demigod so
soon.</p>

<p>As we went back through the churchyard,
we saw a spot where nearly four hundred
inhabitants of Dumfries were buried
during the cholera year; and also some
curious old monuments, with raised letters,
the inscriptions on which were not sufficiently
legible to induce us to puzzle them
out; but, I believe, they mark the resting-places
of old Covenanters, some of whom
were killed by Claverhouse and his fellow-ruffians.</p>

<p>St. Michael's Church is of red freestone,
and was built about a hundred years ago,
on an old Catholic foundation. Our guide
admitted us into it, and showed us, in the
porch, a very pretty little marble figure
of a child asleep, with a drapery over the
lower part, from beneath which appeared
its two baby feet. It was truly a sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
little statue; and the woman told us that
it represented a child of the sculptor, and
that the baby (here still in its marble infancy)
had died more than twenty-six years
ago. "Many ladies," she said, "especially
such as had ever lost a child, had shed
tears over it." It was very pleasant to
think of the sculptor bestowing the best of
his genius and art to re-create his tender
child in stone, and to make the representation
as soft and sweet as the original; but
the conclusion of the story has something
that jars with our awakened sensibilities.
A gentleman from London had seen the
statue, and was so much delighted with it
that he bought it of the father-artist, after
it had lain above a quarter of a century in
the church-porch. So this was not the
real, tender image that came out of the
father's heart; he had sold that truest one
for a hundred guineas, and sculptured this
mere copy to replace it. The first figure
was entirely naked in its earthly and spiritual
innocence. The copy, as I have said
above, has a drapery over the lower limbs.
But, after all, if we come to the truth of
the matter, the sleeping baby may be as
fitly reposited in the drawing-room of a
connoisseur as in a cold and dreary church-porch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>We went into the church, and found it
very plain and naked, without altar decorations,
and having its floor quite covered
with unsightly wooden pews. The woman
led us to a pew, cornering on one of the
side aisles, and, telling us that it used to be
Burns's family pew, showed us his seat,
which is in the corner by the aisle. It is
so situated, that a sturdy pillar hid him
from the pulpit, and from the minister's
eye; "for Robin was no great friends with
the ministers," said she. This touch&mdash;his
seat behind the pillar, and Burns himself
nodding in sermon-time, or keenly observant
of profane things&mdash;brought him before
us to the life. In the corner-seat of
the next pew, right before Burns, and not
more than two feet off, sat the young lady
on whom the poet saw that unmentionable
parasite, which he has immortalized
in song. We were ungenerous enough to
ask the lady's name, but the good woman
could not tell it. This was the last thing
which we saw in Dumfries worthy of record;
and it ought to be noted that our guide refused
some money which my companion
offered her, because I had already paid her
what she deemed sufficient.</p>

<p>At the railway-station we spent more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>than a weary hour, waiting for the train,
which at last came up, and took us to
Mauchline. We got into an omnibus, the
only conveyance to be had, and drove about
a mile to the village, where we established
ourselves at the Loudoun Hotel, one of
the veriest country inns which we have
found in Great Britain. The town of
Mauchline, a place more redolent of Burns
than almost any other, consists of a street
or two of contiguous cottages, mostly whitewashed,
and with thatched roofs. It has
nothing sylvan or rural in the immediate
village, and is as ugly a place as mortal man
could contrive to make, or to render uglier
through a succession of untidy generations.
The fashion of paving the village street, and
patching one shabby house on the gable-end
of another, quite shuts out all verdure
and pleasantness; but, I presume, we are
not likely to see a more genuine old Scotch
village, such as they used to be in Burns's
time, and long before, than this of Mauchline.
The church stands about midway up
the street, and is built of red freestone,
very simple in its architecture, with a square
tower and pinnacles. In this sacred edifice,
and its churchyard, was the scene of one
of Burns's most characteristic productions,
"The Holy Fair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost directly opposite its gate, across
the village street, stands Posie Nansie's inn,
where the "Jolly Beggars" congregated.
The latter is a two-story, red-stone, thatched
house, looking old, but by no means venerable,
like a drunken patriarch. It has
small, old-fashioned windows, and may well
have stood for centuries,&mdash;though, seventy
or eighty years ago, when Burns was conversant
with it, I should fancy it might
have been something better than a beggars'
alehouse. The whole town of Mauchline
looks rusty and time-worn,&mdash;even the
newer houses, of which there are several,
being shadowed and darkened by the general
aspect of the place. When we arrived,
all the wretched little dwellings seemed to
have belched forth their inhabitants into
the warm summer evening: everybody was
chatting with everybody, on the most familiar
terms; the bare-legged children
gamboled or quarreled uproariously, and
came freely, moreover, and looked into the
window of our parlor. When we ventured
out, we were followed by the gaze of the
old town: people standing in their doorways,
old women popping their heads from
the chamber-windows, and stalwart men&mdash;idle
on Saturday at e'en, after their week's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
hard labor&mdash;clustering at the street-corners,
merely to stare at our unpretending
selves. Except in some remote little town
of Italy (where, besides, the inhabitants had
the intelligible stimulus of beggary), I have
never been honored with nearly such an
amount of public notice.</p>

<p>The next forenoon my companion put
me to shame by attending church, after
vainly exhorting me to do the like; and it
being Sacrament Sunday, and my poor
friend being wedged into the farther end
of a closely filled pew, he was forced to
stay through the preaching of four several
sermons, and came back perfectly exhausted
and desperate. He was somewhat consoled,
however, on finding that he had witnessed
a spectacle of Scotch manners identical with
that of Burns's "Holy Fair" on the very
spot where the poet located that immortal
description. By way of further conformance
to the customs of the country, we
ordered a sheep's head and the broth, and
did penance accordingly; and at five o'clock
we took a fly, and set out for Burns's farm
of Moss Giel.</p>

<p>Moss Giel is not more than a mile from
Mauchline, and the road extends over a
high ridge of land, with a view of far hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and green slopes on either side. Just before
we reached the farm, the driver stopped
to point out a hawthorn, growing by the
wayside, which he said was Burns's "Lousie
Thorn;" and I devoutly plucked a branch,
although I have really forgotten where or
how this illustrious shrub has been celebrated.
We then turned into a rude gateway,
and almost immediately came to the
farm-house of Moss Giel, standing some
fifty yards removed from the high-road,
behind a tall hedge of hawthorn, and considerably
overshadowed by trees. The
house is a whitewashed stone cottage, like
thousands of others in England and Scotland,
with a thatched roof, on which grass
and weeds have intruded a picturesque,
though alien, growth. There is a door and
one window in front, besides another little
window that peeps out among the thatch.
Close by the cottage, and extending back
at right angles from it, so as to inclose the
farm-yard, are two other buildings of the
same size, shape, and general appearance
as the house: any one of the three looks
just as fit for a human habitation as the
two others, and all three look still more
suitable for donkey-stables and pigsties.
As we drove into the farm-yard, bounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
on three sides by these three hovels, a
large dog began to bark at us; and some
women and children made their appearance,
but seemed to demur about admitting
us, because the master and mistress
were very religious people, and had not yet
come back from the Sacrament at Mauchline.</p>

<p>However, it would not do to be turned
back from the very threshold of Robert
Burns; and as the women seemed to be
merely straggling visitors, and nobody, at all
events, had a right to send us away, we went
into the back door, and, turning to the right,
entered a kitchen. It showed a deplorable
lack of housewifely neatness, and in it there
were three or four children, one of whom,
a girl eight or nine years old, held a baby
in her arms. She proved to be the daughter
of the people of the house, and gave us
what leave she could to look about us.
Thence we stepped across the narrow mid-passage
of the cottage into the only other
apartment below stairs, a sitting-room,
where we found a young man eating bread
and cheese. He informed us that he did
not live there, and had only called in to
refresh himself on his way home from
church. This room, like the kitchen, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
a noticeably poor one, and, besides being
all that the cottage had to show for a parlor,
it was a sleeping-apartment, having two
beds, which might be curtained off, on
occasion. The young man allowed us liberty
(so far as in him lay) to go up stairs.
Up we crept, accordingly; and a few steps
brought us to the top of the staircase, over
the kitchen, where we found the wretchedest
little sleeping-chamber in the world,
with a sloping roof under the thatch, and
two beds spread upon the bare floor. This,
most probably, was Burns's chamber; or,
perhaps, it may have been that of his mother's
servant-maid; and, in either case, this
rude floor, at one time or another, must
have creaked beneath the poet's midnight
tread. On the opposite side of the passage
was the door of another attic-chamber,
opening which, I saw a considerable number
of cheeses on the floor.</p>

<p>The whole house was pervaded with a
frowzy smell, and also a dunghill odor;
and it is not easy to understand how the
atmosphere of such a dwelling can be any
more agreeable or salubrious morally than
it appeared to be physically. No virgin,
surely, could keep a holy awe about her
while stowed higgledy-piggledy with coarse-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
rustics into this narrowness and
filth. Such a habitation is calculated to
make beasts of men and women; and it
indicates a degree of barbarism which I
did not imagine to exist in Scotland, that
a tiller of broad fields, like the farmer of
Mauchline, should have his abode in a
pigsty. It is sad to think of anybody&mdash;not
to say a poet, but any human being&mdash;sleeping,
eating, thinking, praying, and
spending all his home-life in this miserable
hovel; but, methinks, I never in the
least knew how to estimate the miracle of
Burns's genius, nor his heroic merit for
being no worse man, until I thus learned
the squalid hindrances amid which he developed
himself. Space, a free atmosphere,
and cleanliness have a vast deal to do with
the possibilities of human virtue.</p>

<p>The biographers talk of the farm of
Moss Giel as being damp and unwholesome;
but I do not see why, outside of the
cottage-walls, it should possess so evil a reputation.
It occupies a high, broad ridge,
enjoying, surely, whatever benefit can come
of a breezy site, and sloping far downward
before any marshy soil is reached. The
high hedge, and the trees that stand beside
the cottage, give it a pleasant aspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
enough to one who does not know the
grimy secrets of the interior; and the
summer afternoon was now so bright that
I shall remember the scene with a great
deal of sunshine over it.</p>

<p>Leaving the cottage, we drove through
a field, which the driver told us was that
in which Burns turned up the mouse's
nest. It is the inclosure nearest to the
cottage, and seems now to be a pasture,
and a rather remarkably unfertile one. A
little farther on, the ground was whitened
with an immense number of daisies,&mdash;daisies,
daisies everywhere; and in answer
to my inquiry, the driver said that this was
the field where Burns ran his ploughshare
over the daisy. If so, the soil seems to
have been consecrated to daisies by the
song which he bestowed on that first immortal
one. I alighted, and plucked a
whole handful of these "wee, modest, crimson-tipped
flowers," which will be precious
to many friends in our own country as
coming from Burns's farm, and being of
the same race and lineage as that daisy
which he turned into an amaranthine flower
while seeming to destroy it.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Southport</span>, <i>May 10th</i>. The grass has been green
for a month,&mdash;indeed, it has never been entirely brown,
and now the trees and hedges are beginning to be in
foliage. Weeks ago the daisies bloomed, even in the
sandy grass-plot bordering on the promenade beneath
our front windows; and in the progress of the daisy,
and towards its consummation, I saw the propriety of
Burns's epithet, "wee, modest, <i>crimson-tipped</i> flower,"&mdash;its
little white petals in the bud being fringed all round
with crimson, which fades into pure white when the
flower blooms.&mdash;II. 419.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p></div>

<p>From Moss Giel we drove through a variety
of pleasant scenes, some of which
were familiar to us by their connection
with Burns. We skirted, too, along a portion
of the estate of Auchinleck, which
still belongs to the Boswell family,&mdash;the
present possessor being Sir James Boswell,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a grandson of Johnson's friend, and
son of the Sir Alexander who was killed in
a duel. Our driver spoke of Sir James as
a kind, free-hearted man, but addicted to
horse-races and similar pastimes, and a
little too familiar with the wine-cup; so
that poor Bozzy's booziness would appear
to have become hereditary in his ancient
line. There is no male heir to the estate
of Auchinleck. The portion of the lands
which we saw is covered with wood and
much undermined with rabbit-warrens;
nor, though the territory extends over a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>large number of acres, is the income very
considerable.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Sir James Boswell is now dead.</p></div>

<p>By and by we came to the spot where
Burns saw Miss Alexander, the Lass of
Ballochmyle. It was on a bridge, which
(or, more probably, a bridge that has succeeded
to the old one, and is made of iron)
crosses from bank to bank, high in air
over a deep gorge of the road; so that the
young lady may have appeared to Burns
like a creature between earth and sky, and
compounded chiefly of celestial elements.
But, in honest truth, the great charm of a
woman, in Burns's eyes, was always her
womanhood, and not the angelic mixture
which other poets find in her.</p>

<p>Our driver pointed out the course taken
by the Lass of Ballochmyle, through the
shrubbery, to a rock on the banks of the
Lugar, where it seems to be the tradition
that Burns accosted her. The song implies
no such interview. Lovers, of whatever
condition, high or low, could desire
no lovelier scene in which to breathe their
vows: the river flowing over its pebbly
bed, sometimes gleaming into the sunshine,
sometimes hidden deep in verdure,
and here and there eddying at the foot of
high and precipitous cliffs. This beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
estate of Ballochmyle is still held by the
family of Alexanders, to whom Burns's
song has given renown on cheaper terms
than any other set of people ever attained
it. How slight the tenure seems! A
young lady happened to walk out, one
summer afternoon, and crossed the path
of a neighboring farmer, who celebrated
the little incident in four or five warm,
rude,&mdash;at least, not refined, though rather
ambitious,&mdash;and somewhat ploughman-like
verses. Burns has written hundreds
of better things; but henceforth, for centuries,
that maiden has free admittance
into the dream-land of Beautiful Women,
and she and all her race are famous. I
should like to know the present head of
the family, and ascertain what value, if any,
the members of it put upon the celebrity
thus won.</p>

<p>We passed through Catrine, known hereabouts
as "the clean village of Scotland."
Certainly, as regards the point indicated,
it has greatly the advantage of Mauchline,
whither we now returned without seeing
anything else worth writing about.</p>

<p>There was a rain-storm during the night,
and, in the morning, the rusty, old, sloping
street of Mauchline was glistening with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
wet, while frequent showers came spattering
down. The intense heat of many days
past was exchanged for a chilly atmosphere,
much more suitable to a stranger's idea of
what Scotch temperature ought to be. We
found, after breakfast, that the first train
northward had already gone by, and that
we must wait till nearly two o'clock for the
next. I merely ventured out once, during
the forenoon, and took a brief walk through
the village, in which I have left little to
describe. Its chief business appears to
be the manufacture of snuff-boxes. There
are perhaps five or six shops, or more, including
those licensed to sell only tea and
tobacco; the best of them have the characteristics
of village stores in the United
States, dealing in a small way with an extensive
variety of articles. I peeped into
the open gateway of the churchyard, and
saw that the ground was absolutely stuffed
with dead people, and the surface crowded
with gravestones, both perpendicular and
horizontal. All Burns's old Mauchline acquaintance
are doubtless there, and the
Armours among them, except Bonny Jean,
who sleeps by her poet's side. The family
of Armour is now extinct in Mauchline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Arriving at the railway-station, we found
a tall, elderly, comely gentleman walking
to and fro and waiting for the train. He
proved to be a Mr. Alexander,&mdash;it may
fairly be presumed the Alexander of Ballochmyle,
a blood relation of the lovely lass.
Wonderful efficacy of a poet's verse, that
could shed a glory from Long Ago on this
old gentleman's white hair! These Alexanders,
by the by, are not an old family on
the Ballochmyle estate; the father of the
lass having made a fortune in trade, and
established himself as the first landed proprietor
of his name in these parts. The
original family was named Whitefoord.</p>

<p>Our ride to Ayr presented nothing very
remarkable; and, indeed, a cloudy and rainy
day takes the varnish off the scenery, and
causes a woful diminution in the beauty
and impressiveness of everything we see.
Much of our way lay along a flat, sandy
level, in a southerly direction. We reached
Ayr in the midst of hopeless rain, and drove
to the King's Arms Hotel. In the intervals
of showers I took peeps at the town, which
appeared to have many modern or modern-fronted
edifices; although there are likewise
tall, gray, gabled, and quaint-looking
houses in the by-streets, here and there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
betokening an ancient place. The town
lies on both sides of the Ayr, which is
here broad and stately, and bordered with
dwellings that look from their windows
directly down into the passing tide.</p>

<p>I crossed the river by a modern and
handsome stone bridge, and recrossed it, at
no great distance, by a venerable structure
of four gray arches, which must have bestridden
the stream ever since the early
days of Scottish history. These are the
"Two Briggs of Ayr," whose midnight
conversation was overheard by Burns, while
other auditors were aware only of the rush
and rumble of the wintry stream among the
arches. The ancient bridge is steep and
narrow, and paved like a street, and defended
by a parapet of red freestone, except
at the two ends, where some mean old shops
allow scanty room for the pathway to creep
between. Nothing else impressed me hereabouts,
unless I mention that, during the
rain, the women and girls went about the
streets of Ayr barefooted to save their
shoes.</p>

<p>The next morning wore a lowering aspect
as if it felt itself destined to be one
of many consecutive days of storm. After
a good Scotch breakfast, however, of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
herrings and eggs, we took a fly, and started
at a little past ten for the banks of the
Doon. On our way, at about two miles
from Ayr, we drew up at a roadside cottage,
on which was an inscription to the effect
that Robert Burns was born within its
walls. It is now a public house; and, of
course, we alighted and entered its little
sitting-room, which, as we at present see it,
is a neat apartment with the modern improvement
of a ceiling. The walls are
much overscribbled with names of visitors,
and the wooden door of a cupboard in the
wainscot, as well as all the other wood-work
of the room, is cut and carved with initial
letters. So, likewise, are two tables, which,
having received a coat of varnish over the
inscriptions, form really curious and interesting
articles of furniture. I have seldom
(though I do not personally adopt this
mode of illustrating my humble name) felt
inclined to ridicule the natural impulse of
most people thus to record themselves at
the shrines of poets and heroes.</p>

<p>On a panel, let into the wall in a corner
of the room, is a portrait of Burns, copied
from the original picture by Nasmyth. The
floor of this apartment is of boards, which
are probably a recent substitute for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
ordinary flag-stones of a peasant's cottage.
There is but one other room pertaining to
the genuine birthplace of Robert Burns:
it is the kitchen, into which we now went.
It has a floor of flag-stones, even ruder than
those of Shakespeare's house,&mdash;though,
perhaps, not so strangely cracked and broken
as the latter, over which the hoof of
Satan himself might seem to have been
trampling. A new window has been opened
through the wall, towards the road; but on
the opposite side is the little original window,
of only four small panes, through
which came the first daylight that shone
upon the Scottish poet. At the side of
the room, opposite the fireplace, is a recess,
containing a bed, which can be hidden by
curtains. In that humble nook, of all places
in the world, Providence was pleased to deposit
the germ of richest human life which
mankind then had within its circumference.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">Burns&#39;s Birthplace.</p>

<p>These two rooms, as I have said, make
up the whole sum and substance of Burns's
birthplace: for there were no chambers,
nor even attics; and the thatched roof
formed the only ceiling of kitchen and sitting-room,
the height of which was that of
the whole house. The cottage, however, is
attached to another edifice of the same size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>and description, as these little habitations
often are; and, moreover, a splendid addition
has been made to it, since the poet's
renown began to draw visitors to the wayside
alehouse. The old woman of the house
led us through an entry, and showed a
vaulted hall, of no vast dimensions, to be
sure, but marvelously large and splendid
as compared with what might be anticipated
from the outward aspect of the cottage.
It contained a bust of Burns, and
was hung round with pictures and engravings,
principally illustrative of his life and
poems. In this part of the house, too,
there is a parlor, fragrant with tobacco-smoke;
and, no doubt, many a noggin of
whiskey is here quaffed to the memory of
the bard, who professed to draw so much
inspiration from that potent liquor.</p>

<p>We bought some engravings of Kirk
Alloway, the Bridge of Doon, and the monument,
and gave the old woman a fee besides,
and took our leave. A very short
drive farther brought us within sight of the
monument, and to the hotel, situated close
by the entrance of the ornamental grounds
within which the former is inclosed. We
rang the bell at the gate of the inclosure,
but were forced to wait a considerable time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
because the old man, the regular superintendent
of the spot, had gone to assist at
the laying of the corner-stone of a new
kirk. He appeared anon, and admitted us,
but immediately hurried away to be present
at the concluding ceremonies, leaving us
locked up with Burns.</p>

<p>The inclosure around the monument is
beautifully laid out as an ornamental garden,
and abundantly provided with rare
flowers and shrubbery, all tended with loving
care. The monument stands on an elevated
site, and consists of a massive basement
story, three-sided, above which rises
a light and elegant Grecian temple,&mdash;a
mere dome, supported on Corinthian pillars,
and open to all the winds. The edifice
is beautiful in itself; though I know
not what peculiar appropriateness it may
have, as the memorial of a Scottish rural
poet.</p>

<p>The door of the basement story stood
open; and, entering, we saw a bust of
Burns in a niche, looking keener, more refined,
but not so warm and whole-souled
as his pictures usually do. I think the
likeness cannot be good. In the centre of
the room stood a glass case, in which were
reposited the two volumes of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Pocket Bible that Burns gave to Highland
Mary, when they pledged their troth to
one another. It is poorly printed on coarse
paper. A verse of Scripture referring to
the solemnity and awfulness of vows is written
within the cover of each volume, in the
poet's own hand; and fastened to one of
the covers is a lock of Highland Mary's
golden hair. This Bible had been carried
to America by one of her relatives, but was
sent back to be fitly treasured here.</p>

<p>There is a staircase within the monument,
by which we ascended to the top,
and had a view of both Briggs of Doon:
the scene of Tam O'Shanter's misadventure
being close at hand. Descending, we
wandered through the inclosed garden, and
came to a little building in a corner, on entering
which, we found the two statues of
Tam and Sutor Wat,&mdash;ponderous stone-work
enough, yet permeated in a remarkable
degree with living warmth and jovial
hilarity. From this part of the garden,
too, we again beheld the old Brigg of
Doon, over which Tam galloped in such
imminent and awful peril. It is a beautiful
object in the landscape, with one high,
graceful arch, ivy-grown, and shadowed all
over and around with foliage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">The Auld Brig o&#39; Doon.</p>

<p>When we had waited a good while, the
old gardener came, telling us that he had
heard an excellent prayer at laying the corner-stone
of the new kirk. He now gave
us some roses and sweetbrier, and let us
out from his pleasant garden. We immediately
hastened to Kirk Alloway, which
is within two or three minutes' walk of the
monument. A few steps ascend from the
roadside, through a gate, into the old
graveyard, in the midst of which stands
the kirk. The edifice is wholly roofless,
but the side-walls and gable-ends are quite
entire, though portions of them are evidently
modern restorations. Never was
there a plainer little church, or one with
smaller architectural pretensions; no New
England meeting-house has more simplicity
in its very self, though poetry and fun
have clambered and clustered so wildly
over Kirk Alloway that it is difficult to
see it as it actually exists. By the by,
I do not understand why Satan and an assembly
of witches should hold their revels
within a consecrated precinct; but the
weird scene has so established itself in the
world's imaginative faith that it must be
accepted as an authentic incident, in spite
of rule and reason to the contrary. Pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>sibly,
some carnal minister, some priest of
pious aspect and hidden infidelity, had dispelled
the consecration of the holy edifice
by his pretense of prayer, and thus made
it the resort of unhappy ghosts and sorcerers
and devils.</p>

<p>The interior of the kirk, even now, is
applied to quite as impertinent a purpose
as when Satan and the witches used it as
a dancing-hall; for it is divided in the
midst by a wall of stone-masonry, and each
compartment has been converted into a
family burial-place. The name on one of
the monuments is Crawfurd; the other
bore no inscription. It is impossible not
to feel that these good people, whoever
they may be, had no business to thrust
their prosaic bones into a spot that belongs
to the world, and where their presence jars
with the emotions, be they sad or gay,
which the pilgrim brings thither. They
shut us out from our own precincts, too,&mdash;from
that inalienable possession which
Burns bestowed in free gift upon mankind,
by taking it from the actual earth and annexing
it to the domain of imagination.
And here these wretched squatters have
lain down to their long sleep, after barring
each of the two doorways of the kirk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
an iron grate! May their rest be troubled,
till they rise and let us in!</p>

<p>Kirk Alloway is inconceivably small,
considering how large a space it fills in our
imagination before we see it. I paced its
length, outside of the wall, and found it
only seventeen of my paces, and not more
than ten of them in breadth. There seem
to have been but very few windows, all of
which, if I rightly remember, are now
blocked up with mason-work of stone.
One mullioned window, tall and narrow, in
the eastern gable, might have been seen
by Tam O'Shanter, blazing with devilish
light, as he approached along the road
from Ayr; and there is a small and square
one, on the side nearest the road, into
which he might have peered, as he sat on
horseback. Indeed, I could easily have
looked through it, standing on the ground,
had not the opening been walled up. There
is an odd kind of belfry at the peak of
one of the gables, with the small bell still
hanging in it. And this is all that I
remember of Kirk Alloway, except that
the stones of its material are gray and
irregular.</p>

<p class="caption">Alloway Kirk.</p>

<p>The road from Ayr passes Alloway Kirk,
and crosses the Doon by a modern bridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>without swerving much from a straight
line. To reach the old bridge, it appears
to have made a bend, shortly after passing
the kirk, and then to have turned sharply
towards the river. The new bridge is
within a minute's walk of the monument;
and we went thither, and leaned over its
parapet to admire the beautiful Doon, flowing
wildly and sweetly between its deep
and wooded banks. I never saw a lovelier
scene; although this might have been even
lovelier if a kindly sun had shone upon it.
The ivy-grown, ancient bridge, with its
high arch, through which we had a picture
of the river and the green banks beyond,
was absolutely the most picturesque object,
in a quiet and gentle way, that ever
blessed my eyes. Bonny Doon, with its
wooded banks, and the boughs dipping into
the water! The memory of them, at this
moment, affects me like the song of birds,
and Burns crooning some verses, simple
and wild, in accordance with their native
melody.</p>

<p>It was impossible to depart without crossing
the very bridge of Tam's adventure;
so we went thither, over a now disused
portion of the road, and, standing on the
centre of the arch, gathered some ivy-leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
from that sacred spot. This done, we returned
as speedily as might be to Ayr,
whence, taking the rail, we soon beheld
Ailsa Craig rising like a pyramid out of
the sea. Drawing nearer to Glasgow, Ben
Lomond hove in sight, with a dome-like
summit, supported by a shoulder on each
side. But a man is better than a mountain;
and we had been holding intercourse,
if not with the reality, at least with the
stalwart ghost of one of Earth's memorable
sons, amid the scenes where he lived
and sung. We shall appreciate him better
as a poet, hereafter; for there is no writer
whose life, as a man, has so much to do
with his fame, and throws such a necessary
light upon whatever he has produced.
Henceforth, there will be a personal
warmth for us in everything that he
wrote; and, like his countrymen, we shall
know him in a kind of personal way, as if
we had shaken hands with him, and felt
the thrill of his actual voice.</p>

<p class="h3">A LONDON SUBURB</p>

<p>One of our English summers looks, in the
retrospect, as if it had been patched with
more frequent sunshine than the sky of
England ordinarily affords; but I believe
that it may be only a moral effect,&mdash;a
"light that never was on sea or land,"&mdash;caused
by our having found a particularly
delightful abode in the neighborhood of
London. In order to enjoy it, however,
I was compelled to solve the problem of
living in two places at once,&mdash;an impossibility
which I so far accomplished as to
vanish, at frequent intervals, out of men's
sight and knowledge on one side of England,
and take my place in a circle of
familiar faces on the other, so quietly that
I seemed to have been there all along. It
was the easier to get accustomed to our
new residence, because it was not only rich
in all the material properties of a home,
but had also the home-like atmosphere, the
household element, which is of too intangible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
a character to be let even with the
most thoroughly furnished lodging-house.
A friend had given us his suburban residence,
with all its conveniences, elegances,
and snuggeries,&mdash;its drawing-rooms and
library, still warm and bright with the recollection
of the genial presences that we had
known there,&mdash;its closets, chambers, kitchen,
and even its wine-cellar, if we could
have availed ourselves of so dear and delicate
a trust,&mdash;its lawn and cosey garden-nooks,
and whatever else makes up the
multitudinous idea of an English home,&mdash;he
had transferred it all to us, pilgrims and
dusty wayfarers, that we might rest and
take our ease during his summer's absence
on the Continent. We had long been
dwelling in tents, as it were, and morally
shivering by hearths which, heap the bituminous
coal upon them as we might, no
blaze could render cheerful. I remember,
to this day, the dreary feeling with which
I sat by our first English fireside, and
watched the chill and rainy twilight of
an autumn day darkening down upon the
garden; while the portrait of the preceding
occupant of the house (evidently a most unamiable
personage in his lifetime) scowled
inhospitably from above the mantelpiece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
as if indignant that an American should try
to make himself at home there. Possibly
it may appease his sulky shade to know
that I quitted his abode as much a stranger
as I entered it. But now, at last, we were
in a genuine British home, where refined
and warm-hearted people had just been
living their daily life, and had left us
a summer's inheritance of slowly ripened
days, such as a stranger's hasty opportunities
so seldom permit him to enjoy.</p>

<p>Within so trifling a distance of the central
spot of all the world (which, as Americans
have at present no centre of their own,
we may allow to be somewhere in the vicinity,
we will say, of St. Paul's Cathedral), it
might have seemed natural that I should be
tossed about by the turbulence of the vast
London whirlpool. But I had drifted into
a still eddy, where conflicting movements
made a repose, and, wearied with a good
deal of uncongenial activity, I found the
quiet of my temporary haven more attractive
than anything that the great town
could offer. I already knew London well;
that is to say, I had long ago satisfied (so
far as it was capable of satisfaction) that
mysterious yearning&mdash;the magnetism of
millions of hearts operating upon one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>&mdash;which
impels every man's individuality to
mingle itself with the immensest mass of
human life within his scope. Day after
day, at an earlier period, I had trodden the
thronged thoroughfares, the broad, lonely
squares, the lanes, alleys, and strange labyrinthine
courts, the parks, the gardens and
inclosures of ancient studious societies, so
retired and silent amid the city uproar, the
markets, the foggy streets along the riverside,
the bridges,&mdash;I had sought all parts
of the metropolis, in short, with an unweariable
and indiscriminating curiosity; until
few of the native inhabitants, I fancy, had
turned so many of its corners as myself.
These aimless wanderings (in which my
prime purpose and achievement were to
lose my way, and so to find it the more
surely) had brought me, at one time or
another, to the sight and actual presence
of almost all the objects and renowned
localities that I had read about, and which
had made London the dream-city of my
youth. I had found it better than my
dream; for there is nothing else in life
comparable (in that species of enjoyment,
I mean) to the thick, heavy, oppressive,
sombre delight which an American is sensible
of, hardly knowing whether to call it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
a pleasure or a pain, in the atmosphere of
London. The result was, that I acquired
a home-feeling there, as nowhere else in
the world,&mdash;though afterwards I came to
have a somewhat similar sentiment in regard
to Rome; and as long as either of
those two great cities shall exist, the cities
of the Past and of the Present, a man's
native soil may crumble beneath his feet
without leaving him altogether homeless
upon earth.</p>

<p>Thus, having once fully yielded to its
influence, I was in a manner free of the
city, and could approach or keep away from
it as I pleased. Hence it happened that,
living within a quarter of an hour's rush of
the London Bridge Terminus, I was oftener
tempted to spend a whole summer day in
our garden than to seek anything new or
old, wonderful or commonplace, beyond its
precincts. It was a delightful garden, of
no great extent, but comprising a good
many facilities for repose and enjoyment,
such as arbors and garden-seats, shrubbery,
flower-beds, rose-bushes in a profusion of
bloom, pinks, poppies, geraniums, sweetpeas,
and a variety of other scarlet, yellow,
blue, and purple blossoms, which I did not
trouble myself to recognize individually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
yet had always a vague sense of their
beauty about me. The dim sky of England
has a most happy effect on the coloring of
flowers, blending richness with delicacy in
the same texture; but in this garden, as
everywhere else, the exuberance of English
verdure had a greater charm than any tropical
splendor or diversity of hue. The
hunger for natural beauty might be satisfied
with grass and green leaves forever.
Conscious of the triumph of England in
this respect, and loyally anxious for the
credit of my own country, it gratified me
to observe what trouble and pains the English
gardeners are fain to throw away in
producing a few sour plums and abortive
pears and apples,&mdash;as, for example, in this
very garden, where a row of unhappy trees
were spread out perfectly flat against a
brick wall, looking as if impaled alive, or
crucified, with a cruel and unattainable
purpose of compelling them to produce rich
fruit by torture. For my part, I never ate
an English fruit, raised in the open air,
that could compare in flavor with a Yankee
turnip.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus106.jpg" width="600" height="365" alt="A Country House." title="">
</div>

<p class="caption">A Country House.</p>

<p>The garden included that prime feature
of English domestic scenery, a lawn. It
had been leveled, carefully shorn, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>verted
into a bowling-green, on which we
sometimes essayed to practice the time-honored
game of bowls, most unskillfully,
yet not without a perception that it involves
a very pleasant mixture of exercise
and ease, as is the case with most of the
old English pastimes. Our little domain
was shut in by the house on one side, and
in other directions by a hedge-fence and a
brick wall, which last was concealed or softened
by shrubbery and the impaled fruit-trees
already mentioned. Over all the outer
region, beyond our immediate precincts,
there was an abundance of foliage, tossed
aloft from the near or distant trees with
which that agreeable suburb is adorned.
The effect was wonderfully sylvan and
rural, insomuch that we might have fancied
ourselves in the depths of a wooded seclusion;
only that, at brief intervals, we could
hear the galloping sweep of a railway-train
passing within a quarter of a mile, and its
discordant screech, moderated by a little
farther distance, as it reached the Blackheath
Station. That harsh, rough sound,
seeking me out so inevitably, was the voice
of the great world summoning me forth.
I know not whether I was the more pained
or pleased to be thus constantly put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
mind of the neighborhood of London; for,
on the one hand, my conscience stung me
a little for reading a book, or playing with
children in the grass, when there were
so many better things for an enlightened
traveler to do,&mdash;while, at the same time,
it gave a deeper delight to my luxurious
idleness to contrast it with the turmoil
which I escaped. On the whole, however,
I do not repent of a single wasted hour,
and only wish that I could have spent
twice as many in the same way; for the
impression on my memory is, that I was
as happy in that hospitable garden as the
English summer day was long.</p>

<p>One chief condition of my enjoyment
was the weather. Italy has nothing like
it, nor America. There never was such
weather except in England, where, in requital
of a vast amount of horrible east
wind between February and June, and a
brown October and black November, and
a wet, chill, sunless winter, there are a few
weeks of incomparable summer, scattered
through July and August, and the earlier
portion of September, small in quantity,
but exquisite enough to atone for the whole
year's atmospherical delinquencies. After
all, the prevalent sombreness may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
brought out those sunny intervals in such
high relief that I see them, in my recollection,
brighter than they really were: a
little light makes a glory for people who
live habitually in a gray gloom. The English,
however, do not seem to know how
enjoyable the momentary gleams of their
summer are; they call it broiling weather,
and hurry to the seaside with red, perspiring
faces, in a state of combustion and deliquescence;
and I have observed that even
their cattle have similar susceptibilities,
seeking the deepest shade, or standing
midleg deep in pools and streams to cool
themselves, at temperatures which our own
cows would deem little more than barely
comfortable. To myself, after the summer
heats of my native land had somewhat
effervesced out of my blood and memory,
it was the weather of Paradise itself. It
might be a little too warm; but it was
that modest and inestimable superabundance
which constitutes a bounty of Providence,
instead of just a niggardly enough.
During my first year in England, residing
in perhaps the most ungenial part of the
kingdom, I could never be quite comfortable
without a fire on the hearth; in the
second twelvemonth, beginning to get acclimatized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
I became sensible of an austere
friendliness, shy, but sometimes almost tender,
in the veiled, shadowy, seldom smiling
summer; and in the succeeding years,&mdash;whether
that I had renewed my fibre with
English beef and replenished my blood
with English ale, or whatever were the
cause,&mdash;I grew content with winter and
especially in love with summer, desiring
little more for happiness than merely to
breathe and bask. At the midsummer
which we are now speaking of, I must
needs confess that the noontide sun came
down more fervently than I found altogether
tolerable; so that I was fain to
shift my position with the shadow of the
shrubbery, making myself the movable index
of a sundial that reckoned up the
hours of an almost interminable day.</p>

<p>For each day seemed endless, though
never wearisome. As far as your actual
experience is concerned, the English summer
day has positively no beginning and
no end. When you awake, at any reasonable
hour, the sun is already shining
through the curtains; you live through
unnumbered hours of Sabbath quietude,
with a calm variety of incident softly
etched upon their tranquil lapse; and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
length you become conscious that it is
bedtime again, while there is still enough
daylight in the sky to make the pages of
your book distinctly legible. Night, if
there be any such season, hangs down a
transparent veil through which the bygone
day beholds its successor; or, if not
quite true of the latitude of London, it
may be soberly affirmed of the more northern
parts of the island, that To-morrow is
born before its Yesterday is dead. They
exist together in the golden twilight, where
the decrepit old day dimly discerns the face
of the ominous infant; and you, though a
mere mortal, may simultaneously touch
them both with one finger of recollection
and another of prophecy. I cared not how
long the day might be, nor how many of
them. I had earned this repose by a long
course of irksome toil and perturbation,
and could have been content never to stray
out of the limits of that suburban villa and
its garden. If I lacked anything beyond,
it would have satisfied me well enough to
dream about it, instead of struggling for its
actual possession. At least, this was the
feeling of the moment; although the transitory,
flitting, and irresponsible character
of my life there, was perhaps the most enjoyable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
element of all, as allowing me much
of the comfort of house and home, without
any sense of their weight upon my back.
The nomadic life has great advantages, if
we can find tents ready pitched for us at
every stage.</p>

<p>So much for the interior of our abode,&mdash;a
spot of deepest quiet, within reach of the
intensest activity. But, even when we
stepped beyond our own gate, we were not
shocked with any immediate presence of
the great world. We were dwelling in one
of those oases that have grown up (in comparatively
recent years, I believe) on the
wide waste of Blackheath, which otherwise
offers a vast extent of unoccupied ground
in singular proximity to the metropolis.
As a general thing, the proprietorship of
the soil seems to exist in everybody and
nobody; but exclusive rights have been
obtained, here and there, chiefly by men
whose daily concerns link them with London,
so that you find their villas or boxes
standing along village streets which have
often more of an American aspect than the
elder English settlements. The scene is
semi-rural. Ornamental trees overshadow
the sidewalks, and grassy margins border
the wheel-tracks. The houses, to be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
have certain points of difference from those
of an American village, bearing tokens of
architectural design, though seldom of individual
taste; and, as far as possible, they
stand aloof from the street, and separated
each from its neighbor by hedge or fence,
in accordance with the careful exclusiveness
of the English character, which impels
the occupant, moreover, to cover the front
of his dwelling with as much concealment
of shrubbery as his limits will allow.
Through the interstices, you catch glimpses
of well-kept lawns, generally ornamented
with flowers, and with what the English
call rock-work, being heaps of ivy-grown
stones and fossils, designed for romantic
effect in a small way. Two or three of
such village streets as are here described
take a collective name,&mdash;as, for instance,
Blackheath Park,&mdash;and constitute a kind
of community of residents, with gateways,
kept by a policeman, and a semi-privacy,
stepping beyond which, you find yourself
on the breezy heath.</p>

<p>On this great, bare, dreary common I
often went astray, as I afterwards did on
the Campagna of Rome, and drew the air
(tainted with London smoke though it
might be) into my lungs by deep inspirations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
with a strange and unexpected sense
of desert freedom. The misty atmosphere
helps you to fancy a remoteness that perhaps
does not quite exist. During the little
time that it lasts, the solitude is as impressive
as that of a Western prairie or forest;
but soon the railway shriek, a mile or two
away, insists upon informing you of your
whereabout; or you recognize in the distance
some landmark that you may have
known,&mdash;an insulated villa, perhaps, with
its garden-wall around it, or the rudimental
street of a new settlement which is sprouting
on this otherwise barren soil. Half
a century ago, the most frequent token
of man's beneficent contiguity might have
been a gibbet, and the creak, like a tavern
sign, of a murderer swinging to and fro in
irons. Blackheath, with its highwaymen
and footpads, was dangerous in those days;
and even now, for aught I know, the Western
prairie may still compare favorably with
it as a safe region to go astray in. When
I was acquainted with Blackheath, the ingenious
device of garroting had recently
come into fashion; and I can remember,
while crossing those waste places at midnight,
and hearing footsteps behind me, to
have been sensibly encouraged by also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
hearing, not far off, the clinking hoof-tramp
of one of the horse-patrols who do regular
duty there. About sunset, or a little later,
was the time when the broad and somewhat
desolate peculiarity of the heath
seemed to me to put on its utmost impressiveness.
At that hour, finding myself on
elevated ground, I once had a view of
immense London, four or five miles off,
with the vast Dome in the midst, and the
towers of the two Houses of Parliament
rising up into the smoky canopy, the thinner
substance of which obscured a mass of
things, and hovered about the objects that
were most distinctly visible,&mdash;a glorious
and sombre picture, dusky, awful, but irresistibly
attractive, like a young man's dream
of the great world, foretelling at that distance
a grandeur never to be fully realized.</p>

<p>While I lived in that neighborhood, the
tents of two or three sets of cricket-players
were constantly pitched on Blackheath, and
matches were going forward that seemed
to involve the honor and credit of communities
or counties, exciting an interest
in everybody but myself, who cared not
what part of England might glorify itself
at the expense of another. It is necessary
to be born an Englishman, I believe, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
order to enjoy this great national game; at
any rate, as a spectacle for an outside observer,
I found it lazy, lingering, tedious,
and utterly devoid of pictorial effects.
Choice of other amusements was at hand.
Butts for archery were established, and
bows and arrows were to be let, at so many
shots for a penny,&mdash;there being abundance
of space for a farther flight-shot than any
modern archer can lend to his shaft. Then
there was an absurd game of throwing a
stick at crockery-ware, which I have witnessed
a hundred times, and personally
engaged in once or twice, without ever
having the satisfaction to see a bit of
broken crockery. In other spots you found
donkeys for children to ride, and ponies of
a very meek and patient spirit, on which
the Cockney pleasure-seekers of both sexes
rode races and made wonderful displays of
horsemanship. By way of refreshment
there was gingerbread (but, as a true patriot,
I must pronounce it greatly inferior
to our native dainty), and ginger-beer,
and probably stancher liquor among the
booth-keeper's hidden stores. The frequent
railway-trains, as well as the numerous
steamers to Greenwich, have made
the vacant portions of Blackheath a play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>-ground
and breathing-place for the Londoners,
readily and very cheaply accessible;
so that, in view of this broader use and
enjoyment, I a little grudged the tracts
that have been filched away, so to speak,
and individualized by thriving citizens.
One sort of visitors especially interested
me: they were schools of little boys or
girls, under the guardianship of their instructors,&mdash;charity
schools, as I often surmised
from their aspect, collected among
dark alleys and squalid courts; and hither
they were brought to spend a summer afternoon,
these pale little progeny of the
sunless nooks of London, who had never
known that the sky was any broader than
that narrow and vapory strip above their
native lane. I fancied that they took but
a doubtful pleasure, being half affrighted
at the wide, empty space overhead and
round about them, finding the air too little
medicated with smoke, soot, and graveyard
exhalations, to be breathed with comfort,
and feeling shelterless and lost because
grimy London, their slatternly and disreputable
mother, had suffered them to stray
out of her arms.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">The Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Passing among these holiday people, we
come to one of the gateways of Greenwich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Park, opening through an old brick wall.
It admits us from the bare heath into a
scene of antique cultivation and woodland
ornament, traversed in all directions by
avenues of trees, many of which bear tokens
of a venerable age. These broad and
well-kept pathways rise and decline over
the elevations, and along the bases of
gentle hills, which diversify the whole surface
of the park. The loftiest and most
abrupt of them (though but of very moderate
height) is one of the earth's noted
summits, and may hold up its head with
Mont Blanc and Chimborazo, as being the
site of Greenwich Observatory, where, if
all nations will consent to say so, the longitude
of our great globe begins. I used to
regulate my watch by the broad dial-plate
against the observatory wall, and felt it
pleasant to be standing at the very centre
of Time and Space.</p>

<p>There are lovelier parks than this in the
neighborhood of London, richer scenes of
greensward and cultivated trees; and Kensington,
especially, in a summer afternoon,
has seemed to me as delightful as any
place can or ought to be, in a world which,
some time or other, we must quit. But
Greenwich, too, is beautiful,&mdash;a spot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the art of man has conspired with Nature,
as if he and the great mother had taken
counsel together how to make a pleasant
scene, and the longest liver of the two had
faithfully carried out their mutual design.
It has, likewise, an additional charm of its
own, because, to all appearance, it is the
people's property and play-ground in a
much more genuine way than the aristocratic
resorts in closer vicinity to the metropolis.
It affords one of the instances
in which the monarch's property is actually
the people's, and shows how much more
natural is their relation to the sovereign
than to the nobility, which pretends to
hold the intervening space between the
two: for a nobleman makes a paradise
only for himself, and fills it with his own
pomp and pride; whereas the people are
sooner or later the legitimate inheritors of
whatever beauty kings and queens create,
as now of Greenwich Park. On Sundays,
when the sun shone, and even on those
grim and sombre days when, if it does not
actually rain, the English persist in calling
it fine weather, it was too good to see how
sturdily the plebeians trod under their own
oaks, and what fullness of simple enjoyment
they evidently found there. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
were the people,&mdash;not the populace,&mdash;specimens
of a class whose Sunday clothes
are a distinct kind of garb from their week-day
ones: and this, in England, implies
wholesome habits of life, daily thrift, and
a rank above the lowest. I longed to be
acquainted with them, in order to investigate
what manner of folks they were, what
sort of households they kept, their politics,
their religion, their tastes, and whether
they were as narrow-minded as their betters.
There can be very little doubt of
it; an Englishman is English, in whatever
rank of life, though no more intensely so,
I should imagine, as an artisan or petty
shopkeeper, than as a member of Parliament.</p>

<p>The English character, as I conceive it,
is by no means a very lofty one; they
seem to have a great deal of earth and
grimy dust clinging about them, as was
probably the case with the stalwart and
quarrelsome people who sprouted up out of
the soil, after Cadmus had sown the dragon's
teeth. And yet, though the individual
Englishman is sometimes preternaturally
disagreeable, an observer standing
aloof has a sense of natural kindness towards
them in the lump. They adhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
closer to the original simplicity in which
mankind was created than we ourselves
do; they love, quarrel, laugh, cry, and turn
their actual selves inside out with greater
freedom than any class of Americans would
consider decorous. It was often so with
these holiday folks in Greenwich Park;
and, ridiculous as it may sound, I fancy
myself to have caught very satisfactory
glimpses of Arcadian life among the Cockneys
there, hardly beyond the scope of
Bow-Bells, picnicking in the grass, uncouthly
gamboling on the broad slopes, or
straying in motley groups or by single
pairs of love-making youths and maidens,
along the sun-streaked avenues. Even the
omnipresent policemen or park-keepers
could not disturb the beatific impression
on my mind. One feature, at all events,
of the Golden Age was to be seen in the
herds of deer that encountered you in the
somewhat remoter recesses of the park,
and were readily prevailed upon to nibble
a bit of bread out of your hand. But,
though no wrong had ever been done them,
and no horn had sounded nor hound bayed
at the heels of themselves or their antlered
progenitors for centuries past, there was
still an apprehensiveness lingering in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
hearts; so that a slight movement of the
hand or a step too near would send a whole
squadron of them scampering away, just as
a breath scatters the winged seeds of a
dandelion.</p>

<p>The aspect of Greenwich Park, with all
those festal people wandering through it,
resembled that of the Borghese Gardens
under the walls of Rome, on a Sunday or
Saint's day; but, I am not ashamed to say,
it a little disturbed whatever grimly ghost
of Puritanic strictness might be lingering
in the sombre depths of a New England
heart, among severe and sunless remembrances
of the Sabbaths of childhood, and
pangs of remorse for ill-gotten lessons in
the catechism, and for erratic fantasies or
hardly suppressed laughter in the middle
of long sermons. Occasionally, I tried to
take the long-hoarded sting out of these
compunctious smarts by attending divine
service in the open air. On a cart outside
of the park-wall (and, if I mistake not, at
two or three corners and secluded spots
within the park itself) a Methodist preacher
uplifts his voice and speedily gathers a congregation,
his zeal for whose religious welfare
impels the good man to such earnest
vociferation and toilsome gesture that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
perspiring face is quickly in a stew. His
inward flame conspires with the too fervid
sun, and makes a positive martyr of him,
even in the very exercise of his pious
labor; insomuch that he purchases every
atom of spiritual increment to his hearers
by loss of his own corporeal solidity, and,
should his discourse last long enough, must
finally exhale before their eyes. If I smile
at him, be it understood, it is not in scorn;
he performs his sacred office more acceptably
than many a prelate. These wayside
services attract numbers who would not
otherwise listen to prayer, sermon, or
hymn, from one year's end to another, and
who, for that very reason, are the auditors
most likely to be moved by the preacher's
eloquence. Yonder Greenwich pensioner,
too,&mdash;in his costume of three-cornered
hat, and old-fashioned, brass-buttoned blue
coat with ample skirts, which makes him
look like a contemporary of Admiral Benbow,&mdash;that
tough old mariner may hear a
word or two which will go nearer his heart
than anything that the chaplain of the
Hospital can be expected to deliver. I always
noticed, moreover, that a considerable
proportion of the audience were soldiers,
who came hither with a day's leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
from Woolwich,&mdash;hardy veterans in aspect,
some of whom wore as many as four
or five medals, Crimean or East Indian, on
the breasts of their scarlet coats. The miscellaneous
congregation listen with every
appearance of heartfelt interest; and, for
my own part, I must frankly acknowledge
that I never found it possible to give five
minutes' attention to any other English
preaching: so cold and commonplace are
the homilies that pass for such, under the
aged roofs of churches. And as for cathedrals,
the sermon is an exceedingly diminutive
and unimportant part of the religious
services,&mdash;if, indeed, it be considered a
part,&mdash;among the pompous ceremonies,
the intonations, and the resounding and
lofty-voiced strains of the choristers. The
magnificence of the setting quite dazzles
out what we Puritans look upon as the
jewel of the whole affair; for I presume
that it was our forefathers, the Dissenters
in England and America, who gave the
sermon its present prominence in the Sabbath
exercises.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> We all, together with Mr. Squarey, went to Chester
last Sunday, and attended the cathedral service....
In America the sermon is the principal thing; but here
all this magnificent ceremonial of prayer and chanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
responses and psalms and anthems was the setting to a
short, meagre discourse, which would not have been considered
of any account among the elaborate intellectual
efforts of New England ministers.&mdash;I. 466.</p></div>

<p>The Methodists are probably the first
and only Englishmen who have worshiped
in the open air since the ancient Britons
listened to the preaching of the Druids;
and it reminded me of that old priesthood,
to see certain memorials of their dusky
epoch&mdash;not religious, however, but warlike&mdash;in
the neighborhood of the spot
where the Methodist was holding forth.
These were some ancient barrows, beneath
or within which are supposed to lie buried
the slain of a forgotten or doubtfully remembered
battle, fought on the site of
Greenwich Park as long ago as two or
three centuries after the birth of Christ.
Whatever may once have been their height
and magnitude, they have now scarcely
more prominence in the actual scene than
the battle of which they are the sole monuments
retains in history,&mdash;being only a
few mounds side by side, elevated a little
above the surface of the ground, ten or
twelve feet in diameter, with a shallow depression
in their summits. When one of
them was opened, not long since, no bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
nor armor, nor weapons were discovered,
nothing but some small jewels, and a tuft
of hair,&mdash;perhaps from the head of a valiant
general, who, dying on the field of his
victory, bequeathed this lock, together with
his indestructible fame, to after ages. The
hair and jewels are probably in the British
Museum, where the potsherds and rubbish
of innumerable generations make the visitor
wish that each passing century could
carry off all its fragments and relics along
with it, instead of adding them to the continually
accumulating burden which human
knowledge is compelled to lug upon its
back.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> As for the fame, I know not what
has become of it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The fact is, the world is accumulating too many
materials for knowledge. We do not recognize for rubbish
what is really rubbish; and under this head might
be reckoned very many things one sees in the British
Museum: and, as each generation leaves its fragments
and potsherds behind it, such will finally be the desperate
conclusion of the learned.&mdash;II. 143.
</p><p>
Yesterday I went out at about twelve, and visited
the British Museum; an exceedingly tiresome affair.
It quite crushes a person to see so much at once, and
I wandered from hall to hall with a weary and heavy
heart, wishing (Heaven forgive me!) that the Elgin
Marbles and the frieze of the Parthenon were all burnt
into lime, and that the granite Egyptian statues were
hewn and squared into building-stones, and that the
mummies had all turned to dust two thousand years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
ago; and, in fine, that all the material relics of so many
successive ages had disappeared with the generations
that produced them. The present is burdened too
much with the past. We have not time, in our earthly
existence, to appreciate what is warm with life, and immediately
around us; yet we heap up these old shells,
out of which human life has long emerged, casting them
off forever. I do not see how future ages are to stagger
onward under all this dead weight, with the additions
that will be continually made to it.&mdash;II. 207.</p></div>

<p>After traversing the park, we come into
the neighborhood of Greenwich Hospital,
and will pass through one of its spacious
gateways for the sake of glancing at an establishment
which does more honor to the
heart of England than anything else that
I am acquainted with, of a public nature.
It is very seldom that we can be sensible
of anything like kindliness in the acts or
relations of such an artificial thing as a
National Government. Our own government,
I should conceive, is too much an
abstraction ever to feel any sympathy for
its maimed sailors and soldiers, though it
will doubtless do them a severe kind of
justice, as chilling as the touch of steel.
But it seemed to me that the Greenwich
pensioners are the petted children of the
nation, and that the government is their
dry-nurse, and that the old men themselves
have a child-like consciousness of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
position. Very likely, a better sort of life
might have been arranged, and a wiser
care bestowed on them; but, such as it is,
it enables them to spend a sluggish, careless,
comfortable old age, grumbling, growling,
gruff, as if all the foul weather of their
past years were pent up within them, yet
not much more discontented than such
weather-beaten and battle-battered fragments
of human kind must inevitably be.
Their home, in its outward form, is on a
very magnificent plan. Its germ was a
royal palace, the full expansion of which
has resulted in a series of edifices externally
more beautiful than any English palace
that I have seen, consisting of several
quadrangles of stately architecture, united
by colonnades and gravel-walks, and inclosing
grassy squares, with statues in the
centre, the whole extending along the
Thames. It is built of marble, or very
light-colored stone, in the classic style,
with pillars and porticos, which (to my own
taste, and, I fancy, to that of the old sailors)
produce but a cold and shivery effect
in the English climate. Had I been the
architect, I would have studied the characters,
habits, and predilections of nautical
people in Wapping, Rotherhithe, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
neighborhood of the Tower (places which
I visited in affectionate remembrance of
Captain Lemuel Gulliver, and other actual
or mythological navigators), and would
have built the hospital in a kind of ethereal
similitude to the narrow, dark, ugly,
and inconvenient, but snug and cosey homeliness
of the sailor boarding-houses there.
There can be no question that all the above
attributes, or enough of them to satisfy an
old sailor's heart, might be reconciled with
architectural beauty and the wholesome
contrivances of modern dwellings, and thus
a novel and genuine style of building be
given to the world.</p>

<p>But their countrymen meant kindly by
the old fellows in assigning them the ancient
royal site where Elizabeth held her
court and Charles II. began to build his
palace. So far as the locality went, it was
treating them like so many kings; and,
with a discreet abundance of grog, beer,
and tobacco, there was perhaps little more
to be accomplished in behalf of men whose
whole previous lives have tended to unfit
them for old age. Their chief discomfort
is probably for lack of something to do or
think about. But, judging by the few
whom I saw, a listless habit seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
crept over them, a dim dreaminess of
mood, in which they sit between asleep
and awake, and find the long day wearing
towards bedtime without its having made
any distinct record of itself upon their
consciousness. Sitting on stone benches
in the sunshine, they subside into slumber,
or nearly so, and start at the approach of
footsteps echoing under the colonnades,
ashamed to be caught napping, and rousing
themselves in a hurry, as formerly on
the midnight watch at sea. In their brightest
moments, they gather in groups and
bore one another with endless sea-yarns
about their voyages under famous admirals,
and about gale and calm, battle and chase,
and all that class of incident that has its
sphere on the deck and in the hollow interior
of a ship, where their world has exclusively
been. For other pastime, they
quarrel among themselves, comrade with
comrade, and perhaps shake paralytic fists
in furrowed faces. If inclined for a little
exercise, they can bestir their wooden legs
on the long esplanade that borders by the
Thames, criticising the rig of passing ships,
and firing off volleys of malediction at the
steamers, which have made the sea another
element than that they used to be acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
with. All this is but cold comfort
for the evening of life, yet may compare
rather favorably with the preceding
portions of it, comprising little save imprisonment
on shipboard, in the course of
which they have been tossed all about the
world and caught hardly a glimpse of it,
forgetting what grass and trees are, and
never finding out what woman is, though
they may have encountered a painted spectre
which they took for her. A country
owes much to human beings whose bodies
she has worn out and whose immortal part
she has left undeveloped or debased, as
we find them here; and having wasted an
idle paragraph upon them, let me now suggest
that old men have a kind of susceptibility
to moral impressions, and even (up
to an advanced period) a receptivity of
truth, which often appears to come to them
after the active time of life is past. The
Greenwich pensioners might prove better
subjects for true education now than in
their schoolboy days; but then where is
the Normal School that could educate instructors
for such a class?</p>

<p>There is a beautiful chapel for the pensioners,
in the classic style, over the altar
of which hangs a picture by West. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
never could look at it long enough to make
out its design; for this artist (though it
pains me to say it of so respectable a
countryman) had a gift of frigidity, a knack
of grinding ice into his paint, a power of
stupefying the spectator's perceptions and
quelling his sympathy, beyond any other
limner that ever handled a brush. In spite
of many pangs of conscience, I seize this
opportunity to wreak a lifelong abhorrence
upon the poor, blameless man, for the sake
of that dreary picture of Lear, an explosion
of frosty fury, that used to be a bugbear to
me in the Athen&aelig;um Exhibition. Would
fire burn it, I wonder?</p>

<p>The principal thing that they have to
show you, at Greenwich Hospital, is the
Painted Hall. It is a splendid and spacious
room, at least a hundred feet long and half
as high, with a ceiling painted in fresco by
Sir James Thornhill. As a work of art, I
presume, this frescoed canopy has little
merit, though it produces an exceedingly
rich effect by its brilliant coloring and as a
specimen of magnificent upholstery. The
walls of the grand apartment are entirely
covered with pictures, many of them representing
battles and other naval incidents
that were once fresher in the world's memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
than now, but chiefly portraits of old
admirals, comprising the whole line of heroes
who have trod the quarter-decks of
British ships for more than two hundred
years back. Next to a tomb in Westminster
Abbey, which was Nelson's most elevated
object of ambition, it would seem to
be the highest meed of a naval warrior to
have his portrait hung up in the Painted
Hall; but, by dint of victory upon victory,
these illustrious personages have grown to
be a mob, and by no means a very interesting
one, so far as regards the character
of the faces here depicted. They are generally
commonplace, and often singularly
stolid; and I have observed (both in the
Painted Hall and elsewhere, and not only
in portraits, but in the actual presence of
such renowned people as I have caught
glimpses of) that the countenances of heroes
are not nearly so impressive as those
of statesmen,&mdash;except, of course, in the
rare instances where warlike ability has
been but the one-sided manifestation of a
profound genius for managing the world's
affairs.</p>

<p>Nine tenths of these distinguished admirals,
for instance, if their faces tell
truth, must needs have been blockheads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
and might have served better, one would
imagine, as wooden figure-heads for their
own ships than to direct any difficult and
intricate scheme of action from the quarter-deck.
It is doubtful whether the same
kind of men will hereafter meet with a
similar degree of success; for they were
victorious chiefly through the old English
hardihood, exercised in a field of which
modern science had not yet got possession.
Rough valor has lost something of its value
since their days, and must continue to sink
lower and lower in the comparative estimate
of warlike qualities. In the next
naval war, as between England and France,
I would bet, methinks, upon the Frenchman's
head.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, however, that the great
naval hero of England&mdash;the greatest,
therefore, in the world, and of all time&mdash;had
none of the stolid characteristics
that belong to his class, and cannot fairly
be accepted as their representative man.
Foremost in the roughest of professions,
he was as delicately organized as a woman,
and as painfully sensitive as a poet. More
than any other Englishman he won the love
and admiration of his country, but won
them through the efficacy of qualities that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
are not English, or, at all events, were
intensified in his case and made poignant
and powerful by something morbid in the
man, which put him otherwise at cross-purposes
with life. He was a man of
genius; and genius in an Englishman (not
to cite the good old simile of a pearl in the
oyster) is usually a symptom of a lack of
balance in the general making-up of the
character; as we may satisfy ourselves by
running over the list of their poets, for
example, and observing how many of them
have been sickly or deformed, and how
often their lives have been darkened by
insanity. An ordinary Englishman is the
healthiest and wholesomest of human beings;
an extraordinary one is almost always,
in one way or another, a sick man. It was
so with Lord Nelson. The wonderful contrast
or relation between his personal
qualities, the position which he held, and
the life that he lived, makes him as interesting
a personage as all history has to
show; and it is a pity that Southey's biography&mdash;so
good in its superficial way, and
yet so inadequate as regards any real delineation
of the man&mdash;should have taken the
subject out of the hands of some writer
endowed with more delicate appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and deeper insight than that genuine Englishman
possessed. But Southey accomplished
his own purpose, which, apparently,
was to present his hero as a pattern for
England's young midshipmen.</p>

<p>But the English capacity for hero-worship
is full to the brim with what they
are able to comprehend of Lord Nelson's
character. Adjoining the Painted Hall is
a smaller room, the walls of which are
completely and exclusively adorned with
pictures of the great Admiral's exploits.
We see the frail, ardent man in all the
most noted events of his career, from his
encounter with a Polar Bear to his death
at Trafalgar, quivering here and there about
the room like a blue, lambent flame. No
Briton ever enters that apartment without
feeling the beef and ale of his composition
stirred to its depths, and finding himself
changed into a hero for the nonce, however
stolid his brain, however tough his heart,
however unexcitable his ordinary mood.
To confess the truth, I myself, though belonging
to another parish, have been deeply
sensible to the sublime recollections there
aroused, acknowledging that Nelson expressed
his life in a kind of symbolic poetry
which I had as much right to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
as these burly islanders.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Cool and critical
observer as I sought to be, I enjoyed their
burst of honest indignation when a visitor
(not an American, I am glad to say) thrust
his walking-stick almost into Nelson's face,
in one of the pictures, by way of pointing
a remark; and the by-standers immediately
glowed like so many hot coals, and would
probably have consumed the offender in
their wrath, had he not effected his retreat.
But the most sacred objects of all are
two of Nelson's coats, under separate glass
cases. One is that which he wore at the
Battle of the Nile, and it is now sadly injured
by moths, which will quite destroy it
in a few years, unless its guardians preserve
it as we do Washington's military suit by
occasionally baking it in an oven. The
other is the coat in which he received his
death-wound at Trafalgar. On its breast
are sewed three or four stars and orders
of knighthood, now much dimmed by time
and damp, but which glittered brightly
enough on the battle-day to draw the fatal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>aim of a French marksman. The bullet-hole
is visible on the shoulder, as well as a
part of the golden tassels of an epaulet, the
rest of which was shot away. Over the
coat is laid a white waistcoat, with a great
blood-stain on it, out of which all the redness
has utterly faded, leaving it of a dingy
yellow hue, in the threescore years since
that blood gushed out. Yet it was once
the reddest blood in England,&mdash;Nelson's
blood!</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Even the great sailor, Nelson, was unlike his countrymen
in the qualities that constituted him a hero; he
was not the perfection of an Englishman, but a creature
of another kind,&mdash;sensitive, nervous, excitable, and
really more like a Frenchman.&mdash;II. 531.</p></div>

<p>The hospital stands close adjacent to the
town of Greenwich, which will always retain
a kind of festal aspect in my memory,
in consequence of my having first become
acquainted with it on Easter Monday. Till
a few years ago, the first three days of
Easter were a carnival season in this old
town, during which the idle and disreputable
part of London poured itself into the
streets like an inundation of the Thames,&mdash;as
unclean as that turbid mixture of the
offscourings of the vast city, and overflowing
with its grimy pollution whatever rural
innocence, if any, might be found in the
suburban neighborhood. This festivity was
called Greenwich Fair, the final one of
which, in an immemorial succession, it was
my fortune to behold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>If I had bethought myself of going
through the fair with a note-book and
pencil, jotting down all the prominent objects,
I doubt not that the result might have
been a sketch of English life quite as characteristic
and worthy of historical preservation
as an account of the Roman Carnival.
Having neglected to do so, I remember
little more than a confusion of unwashed
and shabbily dressed people, intermixed
with some smarter figures, but, on the
whole, presenting a mobbish appearance
such as we never see in our own country.
It taught me to understand why Shakespeare,
in speaking of a crowd, so often
alludes to its attribute of evil odor. The
common people of England, I am afraid,
have no daily familiarity with even so
necessary a thing as a wash-bowl, not to
mention a bathing-tub. And, furthermore,
it is one mighty difference between them
and us, that every man and woman on our
side of the water has a working-day suit
and a holiday suit, and is occasionally as
fresh as a rose, whereas, in the good old
country, the griminess of his labor or squalid
habits clings forever to the individual,
and gets to be a part of his personal substance.
These are broad facts, involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
great corollaries and dependencies. There
are really, if you stop to think about it, few
sadder spectacles in the world than a ragged
coat, or a soiled and shabby gown, at a
festival.</p>

<p>This unfragrant crowd was exceedingly
dense, being welded together, as it were,
in the street through which we strove to
make our way. On either side were oyster-stands,
stalls of oranges (a very prevalent
fruit in England, where they give the withered
ones a guise of freshness by boiling
them), and booths covered with old sail-cloth,
in which the commodity that most
attracted the eye was gilt gingerbread. It
was so completely enveloped in Dutch
gilding that I did not at first recognize an
old acquaintance, but wondered what those
golden crowns and images could be. There
were likewise drums and other toys for
small children, and a variety of showy and
worthless articles for children of a larger
growth; though it perplexed me to imagine
who, in such a mob, could have the innocent
taste to desire playthings, or the
money to pay for them. Not that I have
a right to accuse the mob, on my own
knowledge, of being any less innocent than
a set of cleaner and better dressed people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
might have been; for, though one of them
stole my pocket-handkerchief, I could not
but consider it fair game, under the circumstances,
and was grateful to the thief for
sparing me my purse. They were quiet,
civil, and remarkably good-humored, making
due allowance for the national gruffness;
there was no riot, no tumultuous
swaying to and fro of the mass, such as I
have often noted in an American crowd;
no noise of voices, except frequent bursts
of laughter, hoarse or shrill, and a widely
diffused, inarticulate murmur, resembling
nothing so much as the rumbling of the
tide among the arches of London Bridge.
What immensely perplexed me was a sharp,
angry sort of rattle, in all quarters, far off
and close at hand, and sometimes right at
my own back, where it sounded as if the
stout fabric of my English surtout had
been ruthlessly rent in twain; and everybody's
clothes, all over the fair, were evidently
being torn asunder in the same way.
By and by, I discovered that this strange
noise was produced by a little instrument
called "The Fun of the Fair,"&mdash;a sort of
rattle, consisting of a wooden wheel, the
cogs of which turn against a thin slip of
wood, and so produce a rasping sound when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
drawn smartly against a person's back.
The ladies draw their rattles against the
backs of their male friends (and everybody
passes for a friend at Greenwich Fair), and
the young men return the compliment on
the broad British backs of the ladies; and
all are bound by immemorial custom to
take it in good part and be merry at the
joke. As it was one of my prescribed
official duties to give an account of such
mechanical contrivances as might be unknown
in my own country, I have thought
it right to be thus particular in describing
the Fun of the Fair.</p>

<p>But this was far from being the sole
amusement. There were theatrical booths,
in front of which were pictorial representations
of the scenes to be enacted within;
and anon a drummer emerged from one of
them, thumping on a terribly lax drum,
and followed by the entire <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>,
who ranged themselves on a wooden
platform in front of the theatre. They
were dressed in character, but wofully
shabby, with very dingy and wrinkled
white tights, threadbare cotton-velvets,
crumpled silks, and crushed muslin, and
all the gloss and glory gone out of their
aspect and attire, seen thus in the broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
daylight and after a long series of performances.
They sang a song together, and
withdrew into the theatre, whither the public
were invited to follow them at the inconsiderable
cost of a penny a ticket. Before
another booth stood a pair of brawny
fighting-men, displaying their muscle, and
soliciting patronage for an exhibition of
the noble British art of pugilism. There
were pictures of giants, monsters, and outlandish
beasts, most prodigious, to be sure,
and worthy of all admiration, unless the
artist had gone incomparably beyond his
subject. Jugglers proclaimed aloud the
miracles which they were prepared to
work; and posture-makers dislocated every
joint of their bodies and tied their limbs
into inextricable knots, wherever they
could find space to spread a little square
of carpet on the ground. In the midst of
the confusion, while everybody was treading
on his neighbor's toes, some little boys
were very solicitous to brush your boots.
These lads, I believe, are a product of
modern society,&mdash;at least, no older than
the time of Gay, who celebrates their origin
in his "Trivia;" but in most other
respects the scene reminded me of Bunyan's
description of Vanity Fair,&mdash;nor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
it at all improbable that the Pilgrim may
have been a merry-maker here in his wild
youth.</p>

<p>It seemed very singular&mdash;though, of
course, I immediately classified it as an
English characteristic&mdash;to see a great
many portable weighing-machines, the owners
of which cried out continually and
amain, "Come, know your weight! Come,
come, know your weight to-day! Come,
know your weight!" and a multitude of
people, mostly large in the girth, were
moved by this vociferation to sit down in
the machines. I know not whether they
valued themselves on their beef, and estimated
their standing as members of society
at so much a pound; but I shall set it
down as a national peculiarity, and a symbol
of the prevalence of the earthly over
the spiritual element, that Englishmen are
wonderfully bent on knowing how solid and
physically ponderous they are.</p>

<p>On the whole, having an appetite for the
brown bread and the tripe and sausages
of life, as well as for its nicer cates and
dainties, I enjoyed the scene, and was
amused at the sight of a gruff old Greenwich
pensioner, who, forgetful of the sailor-frolics
of his young days, stood looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
with grim disapproval at all these vanities.
Thus we squeezed our way through the
mob-jammed town, and emerged into the
Park, where, likewise, we met a great many
merry-makers, but with freer space for
their gambols than in the streets. We
soon found ourselves the targets for a cannonade
with oranges (most of them in a
decayed condition), which went humming
past our ears from the vantage-ground of
neighboring hillocks, sometimes hitting our
sacred persons with an inelastic thump.
This was one of the privileged freedoms
of the time, and was nowise to be resented,
except by returning the salute. Many persons
were running races, hand in hand,
down the declivities, especially that steepest
one on the summit of which stands the
world-central Observatory, and (as in the
race of life) the partners were usually male
and female, and often caught a tumble together
before reaching the bottom of the
hill. Hereabouts we were pestered and
haunted by two young girls, the elder not
more than thirteen, teasing us to buy
matches; and finding no market for their
commodity, the taller one suddenly turned
a somerset before our faces, and rolled
heels over head from top to bottom of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
hill on which we stood. Then, scrambling
up the acclivity, the topsy-turvy trollop
offered us her matches again, as demurely
as if she had never flung aside her equilibrium;
so that, dreading a repetition of
the feat, we gave her sixpence and an admonition,
and enjoined her never to do so
any more.</p>

<p>The most curious amusement that we
witnessed here&mdash;or anywhere else, indeed&mdash;was
an ancient and hereditary pastime
called "Kissing in the Ring." I shall describe
the sport exactly as I saw it, although
an English friend assures me that there
are certain ceremonies with a handkerchief,
which make it much more decorous
and graceful. A handkerchief, indeed!
There was no such thing in the crowd, except
it were the one which they had just
filched out of my pocket. It is one of the
simplest kinds of games, needing little or
no practice to make the player altogether
perfect; and the manner of it is this: A
ring is formed (in the present case, it was
of large circumference and thickly gemmed
around with faces, mostly on the broad
grin), into the centre of which steps an adventurous
youth, and, looking round the
circle, selects whatever maiden may most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
delight his eye. He presents his hand
(which she is bound to accept), leads her
into the centre, salutes her on the lips, and
retires, taking his stand in the expectant
circle. The girl, in her turn, throws a
favorable regard on some fortunate young
man, offers her hand to lead him forth,
makes him happy with a maidenly kiss,
and withdraws to hide her blushes, if any
there be, among the simpering faces in the
ring; while the favored swain loses no
time in transferring her salute to the prettiest
and plumpest among the many mouths
that are primming themselves in anticipation.
And thus the thing goes on, till all
the festive throng are inwreathed and intertwined
into an endless and inextricable
chain of kisses; though, indeed, it smote
me with compassion to reflect that some
forlorn pair of lips might be left out, and
never know the triumph of a salute, after
throwing aside so many delicate reserves
for the sake of winning it. If the young
men had any chivalry, there was a fair
chance to display it by kissing the homeliest
damsel in the circle.</p>

<p>To be frank, however, at the first glance,
and to my American eye, they looked all
homely alike, and the chivalry that I suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
is more than I could have been capable
of, at any period of my life. They
seemed to be country-lasses, of sturdy and
wholesome aspect, with coarse-grained,
cabbage-rosy cheeks, and, I am willing to
suppose, a stout texture of moral principle,
such as would bear a good deal of rough
usage without suffering much detriment.
But how unlike the trim little damsels of
my native land! I desire above all things
to be courteous; but, since the plain truth
must be told, the soil and climate of England
produce feminine beauty as rarely as
they do delicate fruit; and though admirable
specimens of both are to be met with,
they are the hot-house ameliorations of refined
society, and apt, moreover, to relapse
into the coarseness of the original stock.
The men are manlike, but the women are
not beautiful, though the female Bull be
well enough adapted to the male. To return
to the lasses of Greenwich Fair, their
charms were few, and their behavior, perhaps,
not altogether commendable; and
yet it was impossible not to feel a degree
of faith in their innocent intentions, with
such a half-bashful zest and entire simplicity
did they keep up their part of the
game. It put the spectator in good-humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
to look at them, because there was still
something of the old Arcadian life, the
secure freedom of the antique age, in their
way of surrendering their lips to strangers,
as if there were no evil or impurity in the
world. As for the young men, they were
chiefly specimens of the vulgar sediment
of London life, often shabbily genteel,
rowdyish, pale, wearing the unbrushed coat,
unshifted linen, and unwashed faces of
yesterday, as well as the haggardness of
last night's jollity in a gin-shop. Gathering
their character from these tokens, I
wondered whether there were any reasonable
prospect of their fair partners returning
to their rustic homes with as much innocence
(whatever were its amount or quality)
as they brought to Greenwich Fair, in
spite of the perilous familiarity established
by Kissing in the Ring.</p>

<p>The manifold disorders resulting from
the fair, at which a vast city was brought
into intimate relations with a comparatively
rural district, have at length led to its suppression;
this was the very last celebration
of it, and brought to a close the broad-mouthed
merriment of many hundred years.
Thus my poor sketch, faint as its colors
are, may acquire some little value in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
reader's eyes from the consideration that
no observer of the coming time will ever
have an opportunity to give a better. I
should find it difficult to believe, however,
that the queer pastime just described, or
any moral mischief to which that and other
customs might pave the way, can have led
to the overthrow of Greenwich Fair; for
it has often seemed to me that Englishmen
of station and respectability, unless of a
peculiarly philanthropic turn, have neither
any faith in the feminine purity of the
lower orders of their countrywomen, nor
the slightest value for it, allowing its possible
existence. The distinction of ranks
is so marked, that the English cottage
damsel holds a position somewhat analogous
to that of the negro girl in our Southern
States. Hence comes inevitable detriment
to the moral condition of those men themselves,
who forget that the humblest woman
has a right and a duty to hold herself
in the same sanctity as the highest. The
subject cannot well be discussed in these
pages; but I offer it as a serious conviction,
from what I have been able to observe,
that the England of to-day is the unscrupulous
old England of Tom Jones and Joseph
Andrews, Humphrey Clinker and Roderick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Random; and in our refined era, just
the same as at that more free-spoken epoch,
this singular people has a certain contempt
for any fine-strained purity, any special
squeamishness, as they consider it, on the
part of an ingenuous youth. They appear
to look upon it as a suspicious phenomenon
in the masculine character.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I by no means take upon
me to affirm that English morality, as regards
the phase here alluded to, is really at
a lower point than our own. Assuredly, I
hope so, because, making a higher pretension,
or, at all events, more carefully hiding
whatever may be amiss, we are either better
than they, or necessarily a great deal worse.
It impressed me that their open avowal
and recognition of immoralities served to
throw the disease to the surface, where it
might be more effectually dealt with, and
leave a sacred interior not utterly profaned,
instead of turning its poison back among
the inner vitalities of the character, at the
imminent risk of corrupting them all. Be
that as it may, these Englishmen are certainly
a franker and simpler people than
ourselves, from peer to peasant; but if we
can take it as compensatory on our part
(which I leave to be considered) that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
owe those noble and manly qualities to a
coarser grain in their nature, and that,
with a finer one in ours, we shall ultimately
acquire a marble polish of which they are
unsusceptible, I believe that this may be
the truth.</p>

<p class="h3">UP THE THAMES</p>

<p>The upper portion of Greenwich (where
my last article left me loitering) is a cheerful,
comely, old-fashioned town, the peculiarities
of which, if there be any, have
passed out of my remembrance. As you
descend towards the Thames the streets get
meaner, and the shabby and sunken houses,
elbowing one another for frontage, bear the
signboards of beer-shops and eating-rooms,
with especial promises of white-bait and
other delicacies in the fishing line. You
observe, also, a frequent announcement of
"Tea Gardens" in the rear; although,
estimating the capacity of the premises by
their external compass, the entire sylvan
charm and shadowy seclusion of such blissful
resorts must be limited within a small
back-yard. These places of cheap sustenance
and recreation depend for support
upon the innumerable pleasure-parties who
come from London Bridge by steamer, at
a fare of a few pence, and who get as enjoyable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
a meal for a shilling a head as the
Ship Hotel would afford a gentleman for a
guinea.</p>

<p class="caption">London Bridge.</p>

<p>The steamers, which are constantly
smoking their pipes up and down the
Thames, offer much the most agreeable
mode of getting to London. At least, it
might be exceedingly agreeable, except for
the myriad floating particles of soot from
the stove-pipe, and the heavy heat of midsummer
sunshine on the unsheltered deck,
or the chill, misty air-draught of a cloudy
day, and the spiteful little showers of rain
that may spatter down upon you at any
moment, whatever the promise of the sky;
besides which there is some slight inconvenience
from the inexhaustible throng of
passengers, who scarcely allow you standing-room,
nor so much as a breath of unappropriated
air, and never a chance to sit
down. If these difficulties, added to the
possibility of getting your pocket picked,
weigh little with you, the panorama along
the shores of the memorable river, and the
incidents and shows of passing life upon its
bosom, render the trip far preferable to the
brief yet tiresome shoot along the railway
track. On one such voyage, a regatta of
wherries raced past us, and at once involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
every soul on board our steamer in the tremendous
excitement of the struggle. The
spectacle was but a moment within our
view, and presented nothing more than a
few light skiffs, in each of which sat a
single rower, bare-armed, and with little
apparel, save a shirt and drawers, pale,
anxious, with every muscle on the stretch,
and plying his oars in such fashion that
the boat skimmed along with the aerial
celerity of a swallow. I wondered at myself
for so immediately catching an interest
in the affair, which seemed to contain no
very exalted rivalship of manhood; but,
whatever the kind of battle or the prize of
victory, it stirs one's sympathy immensely,
and is even awful, to behold the rare sight
of a man thoroughly in earnest, doing his
best, putting forth all there is in him, and
staking his very soul (as these rowers appeared
willing to do) on the issue of the
contest. It was the seventy-fourth annual
regatta of the Free Watermen of Greenwich,
and announced itself as under the
patronage of the Lord Mayor and other
distinguished individuals, at whose expense,
I suppose, a prize-boat was offered to the
conqueror, and some small amounts of
money to the inferior competitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>The aspect of London along the Thames,
below Bridge, as it is called, is by no means
so impressive as it ought to be, considering
what peculiar advantages are offered for
the display of grand and stately architecture
by the passage of a river through
the midst of a great city. It seems, indeed,
as if the heart of London had been cleft
open for the mere purpose of showing how
rotten and drearily mean it had become.
The shore is lined with the shabbiest,
blackest, and ugliest buildings that can be
imagined, decayed warehouses with blind
windows, and wharves that look ruinous;
insomuch that, had I known nothing more
of the world's metropolis, I might have
fancied that it had already experienced the
downfall which I have heard commercial
and financial prophets predict for it, within
the century. And the muddy tide of the
Thames, reflecting nothing, and hiding a
million of unclean secrets within its breast,&mdash;a
sort of guilty conscience, as it were,
unwholesome with the rivulets of sin that
constantly flow into it,&mdash;is just the dismal
stream to glide by such a city. The
surface, to be sure, displays no lack of
activity, being fretted by the passage of a
hundred steamers and covered with a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
deal of shipping, but mostly of a clumsier
build than I had been accustomed to see
in the Mersey: a fact which I complacently
attributed to the smaller number of American
clippers in the Thames, and the less
prevalent influence of American example
in refining away the broad-bottomed capacity
of the old Dutch or English models.</p>

<p>About midway between Greenwich and
London Bridge, at a rude landing-place on
the left bank of the river, the steamer rings
its bell and makes a momentary pause in
front of a large circular structure, where it
may be worth our while to scramble ashore.
It indicates the locality of one of those
prodigious practical blunders that would
supply John Bull with a topic of inexhaustible
ridicule if his cousin Jonathan had
committed them, but of which he himself
perpetrates ten to our one in the mere
wantonness of wealth that lacks better employment.
The circular building covers
the entrance to the Thames Tunnel, and is
surmounted by a dome of glass, so as to
throw daylight down into the great depth
at which the passage of the river commences.
Descending a wearisome succession
of staircases, we at last find ourselves,
still in the broad noon, standing before a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
closed door, on opening which we behold
the vista of an arched corridor that extends
into everlasting midnight. In these days,
when glass has been applied to so many
new purposes, it is a pity that the architect
had not thought of arching portions of his
abortive tunnel with immense blocks of
the lucid substance, over which the dusky
Thames would have flowed like a cloud,
making the sub-fluvial avenue only a little
gloomier than a street of upper London.
At present, it is illuminated at regular intervals
by jets of gas, not very brilliantly,
yet with lustre enough to show the damp
plaster of the ceiling and walls, and the
massive stone pavement, the crevices of
which are oozy with moisture, not from the
incumbent river, but from hidden springs
in the earth's deeper heart. There are
two parallel corridors, with a wall between,
for the separate accommodation of the
double throng of foot-passengers, equestrians,
and vehicles of all kinds, which was
expected to roll and reverberate continually
through the tunnel. Only one of them
has ever been opened, and its echoes are
but feebly awakened by infrequent footfalls.</p>

<p>Yet there seem to be people who spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
their lives here, and who probably blink
like owls, when, once or twice a year, perhaps,
they happen to climb into the sunshine.
All along the corridor, which I believe
to be a mile in extent, we see stalls
or shops in little alcoves, kept principally
by women; they were of a ripe age, I was
glad to observe, and certainly robbed England
of none of its very moderate supply of
feminine loveliness by their deeper than
tomb-like interment. As you approach
(and they are so accustomed to the dusky
gaslight that they read all your characteristics
afar off), they assail you with hungry
entreaties to buy some of their merchandise,
holding forth views of the tunnel put
up in cases of Derbyshire spar, with a
magnifying glass at one end to make the
vista more effective. They offer you, besides,
cheap jewelry, sunny topazes, and
resplendent emeralds for sixpence, and diamonds
as big as the Kohinoor at a not
much heavier cost, together with a multifarious
trumpery which has died out of the
upper world to reappear in this Tartarean
bazaar. That you may fancy yourself still
in the realms of the living, they urge you
to partake of cakes, candy, ginger-beer, and
such small refreshment, more suitable, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
for the shadowy appetite of ghosts
than for the sturdy stomachs of Englishmen.
The most capacious of the shops
contains a dioramic exhibition of cities and
scenes in the daylight world, with a dreary
glimmer of gas among them all; so that
they serve well enough to represent the
dim, unsatisfactory remembrances that
dead people might be supposed to retain
from their past lives, mixing them up with
the ghastliness of their unsubstantial state.
I dwell the more upon these trifles, and do
my best to give them a mockery of importance,
because, if these are nothing, then
all this elaborate contrivance and mighty
piece of work has been wrought in vain.
The Englishman has burrowed under the
bed of his great river, and set ships of two
or three thousand tons a-rolling over his
head, only to provide new sites for a few
old women to sell cakes and ginger-beer!</p>

<p>Yet the conception was a grand one;
and though it has proved an absolute failure,
swallowing an immensity of toil and
money, with annual returns hardly sufficient
to keep the pavement free from the
ooze of subterranean springs, yet it needs,
I presume, only an expenditure three or
four (or, for aught I know, twenty) times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
as large, to make the enterprise brilliantly
successful. The descent is so great from
the bank of the river to its surface, and the
tunnel dips so profoundly under the river's
bed, that the approaches on either
side must commence a long way off, in
order to render the entrance accessible to
horsemen or vehicles; so that the larger
part of the cost of the whole affair should
have been expended on its margins. It
has turned out a sublime piece of folly;
and when the New-Zealander of distant
ages shall have moralized sufficiently among
the ruins of London Bridge, he will bethink
himself that somewhere thereabout
was the marvelous Tunnel, the very existence
of which will seem to him as incredible
as that of the hanging gardens of
Babylon. But the Thames will long ago
have broken through the massive arch, and
choked up the corridors with mud and
sand and with the large stones of the
structure itself, intermixed with skeletons
of drowned people, the rusty ironwork of
sunken vessels, and the great many such
precious and curious things as a river always
contrives to hide in its bosom; the
entrance will have been obliterated, and
its very site forgotten beyond the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
of twenty generations of men, and the
whole neighborhood be held a dangerous
spot on account of the malaria; insomuch
that the traveler will make but a brief and
careless inquisition for the traces of the
old wonder, and will stake his credit before
the public, in some Pacific Monthly of that
day, that the story of it is but a myth,
though enriched with a spiritual profundity
which he will proceed to unfold.</p>

<p>Yet it is impossible (for a Yankee, at
least) to see so much magnificent ingenuity
thrown away, without trying to endow
the unfortunate result with some kind of
usefulness, though perhaps widely different
from the purpose of its original conception.
In former ages, the mile-long corridors,
with their numerous alcoves, might
have been utilized as a series of dungeons,
the fittest of all possible receptacles for
prisoners of state. Dethroned monarchs
and fallen statesmen would not have needed
to remonstrate against a domicile so spacious,
so deeply secluded from the world's
scorn, and so admirably in accordance with
their thenceforward sunless fortunes. An
alcove here might have suited Sir Walter
Raleigh better than that darksome hiding-place
communicating with the great chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
in the Tower, pacing from end to end
of which he meditated upon his "History
of the World." His track would here have
been straight and narrow, indeed, and
would therefore have lacked somewhat of
the freedom that his intellect demanded;
and yet the length to which his footsteps
might have traveled forth and retraced
themselves would partly have harmonized
his physical movement with the grand
curves and planetary returns of his thought,
through cycles of majestic periods. Having
it in his mind to compose the world's
history, methinks he could have asked no
better retirement than such a cloister as
this, insulated from all the seductions of
mankind and womankind, deep beneath
their mysteries and motives, down into the
heart of things, full of personal reminiscences
in order to the comprehensive
measurement and verification of historic
records, seeing into the secrets of human
nature,&mdash;secrets that daylight never yet
revealed to mortal,&mdash;but detecting their
whole scope and purport with the infallible
eyes of unbroken solitude and night. And
then the shades of the old mighty men
might have risen from their still profounder
abodes and joined him in the dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
corridor, treading beside him with an antique
stateliness of mien, telling him in
melancholy tones, grand, but always melancholy,
of the greater ideas and purposes
which their most renowned performances
so imperfectly carried out; that, magnificent
successes in the view of all posterity,
they were but failures to those who
planned them. As Raleigh was a navigator,
Noah would have explained to him
the peculiarities of construction that made
the ark so seaworthy; as Raleigh was a
statesman, Moses would have discussed
with him the principles of laws and government;
as Raleigh was a soldier, C&aelig;sar and
Hannibal would have held debate in his
presence, with this martial student for their
umpire; as Raleigh was a poet, David, or
whatever most illustrious bard he might
call up, would have touched his harp, and
made manifest all the true significance of
the past by means of song and the subtle
intelligences of music.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had forgotten that Sir
Walter Raleigh's century knew nothing of
gaslight, and that it would require a prodigious
and wasteful expenditure of tallow-candles
to illuminate the tunnel sufficiently
to discern even a ghost. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
account, however, it would be all the more
suitable place of confinement for a metaphysician,
to keep him from bewildering
mankind with his shadowy speculations;
and, being shut off from external converse,
the dark corridor would help him to make
rich discoveries in those cavernous regions
and mysterious by-paths of the intellect,
which he had so long accustomed himself
to explore. But how would every successive
age rejoice in so secure a habitation
for its reformers, and especially for each
best and wisest man that happened to be
then alive! He seeks to burn up our
whole system of society, under pretense of
purifying it from its abuses! Away with
him into the tunnel, and let him begin by
setting the Thames on fire, if he is able!</p>

<p>If not precisely these, yet akin to these
were some of the fantasies that haunted
me as I passed under the river: for the
place is suggestive of such idle and irresponsible
stuff by its own abortive character,
its lack of whereabout on upper earth,
or any solid foundation of realities. Could
I have looked forward a few years, I might
have regretted that American enterprise
had not provided a similar tunnel, under
the Hudson or the Potomac, for the convenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
of our National Government in
times hardly yet gone by. It would be delightful
to clap up all the enemies of our
peace and Union in the dark together, and
there let them abide, listening to the monotonous
roll of the river above their
heads, or perhaps in a state of miraculously
suspended animation, until,&mdash;be it after
months, years, or centuries,&mdash;when the
turmoil shall be all over, the Wrong washed
away in blood (since that must needs be
the cleansing fluid), and the Right firmly
rooted in the soil which that blood will
have enriched, they might crawl forth again
and catch a single glimpse at their redeemed
country, and feel it to be a better
land than they deserve, and die!</p>

<p>I was not sorry when the daylight
reached me after a much briefer abode in
the nether regions than, I fear, would await
the troublesome personages just hinted at.
Emerging on the Surrey side of the
Thames, I found myself in Rotherhithe, a
neighborhood not unfamiliar to the readers
of old books of maritime adventure. There
being a ferry hard by the mouth of the
tunnel, I recrossed the river in the primitive
fashion of an open boat, which the
conflict of wind and tide, together with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
swash and swell of the passing steamers,
tossed high and low rather tumultuously.
This inquietude of our frail skiff (which,
indeed, bobbed up and down like a cork) so
much alarmed an old lady, the only other
passenger, that the boatmen essayed to
comfort her. "Never fear, mother!"
grumbled one of them; "we'll make the
river as smooth as we can for you. We'll
get a plane, and plane down the waves!"
The joke may not read very brilliantly;
but I make bold to record it as the only
specimen that reached my ears of the old,
rough water-wit for which the Thames
used to be so celebrated. Passing directly
along the line of the sunken tunnel, we
landed in Wapping, which I should have
presupposed to be the most tarry and
pitchy spot on earth, swarming with old
salts, and full of warm, bustling, coarse,
homely, and cheerful life. Nevertheless,
it turned out to be a cold and torpid neighborhood,
mean, shabby, and unpicturesque,
both as to its buildings and inhabitants:
the latter comprising (so far as was visible
to me) not a single unmistakable sailor,
though plenty of land-sharks, who get a
half-dishonest livelihood by business connected
with the sea. Ale and spirit vaults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
(as petty drinking-establishments are styled
in England, pretending to contain vast
cellars full of liquor within the compass
of ten feet square above ground) were
particularly abundant, together with apples,
oranges, and oysters, the stalls of
fishmongers and butchers, and slop-shops,
where blue jackets and duck trousers
swung and capered before the doors.
Everything was on the poorest scale, and
the place bore an aspect of unredeemable
decay. From this remote point of London
I strolled leisurely towards the heart of the
city; while the streets, at first but thinly
occupied by man or vehicle, got more and
more thronged with foot-passengers, carts,
drays, cabs, and the all-pervading and all-accommodating
omnibus. But I lack courage,
and feel that I should lack perseverance,
as the gentlest reader would lack
patience, to undertake a descriptive stroll
through London streets; more especially
as there would be a volume ready for the
printer before we could reach a midway
resting-place at Charing Cross. It will be
the easier course to step aboard another
passing steamer, and continue our trip up
the Thames.</p>

<p>The next notable group of objects is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
assemblage of ancient walls, battlements,
and turrets, out of the midst of which rises
prominently one great square tower, of a
grayish hue, bordered with white stone,
and having a small turret at each corner
of the roof. This central structure is the
White Tower, and the whole circuit of
ramparts and inclosed edifices constitutes
what is known in English history, and still
more widely and impressively in English
poetry, as the Tower. A crowd of river-craft
are generally moored in front of it;
but if we look sharply at the right moment
under the base of the rampart, we may
catch a glimpse of an arched water-entrance,
half submerged, past which the
Thames glides as indifferently as if it were
the mouth of a city-kennel. Nevertheless,
it is the Traitor's Gate, a dreary kind of
triumphal passage-way (now supposed to be
shut up and barred forever), through which
a multitude of noble and illustrious personages
have entered the Tower and found it
a brief resting-place on their way to heaven.
Passing it many times, I never observed
that anybody glanced at this shadowy and
ominous trap-door, save myself. It is well
that America exists, if it were only that
her vagrant children may be impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
and affected by the historical monuments
of England in a degree of which the native
inhabitants are evidently incapable. These
matters are too familiar, too real, and too
hopelessly built in amongst and mixed up
with the common objects and affairs of life,
to be easily susceptible of imaginative
coloring in their minds; and even their
poets and romancers feel it a toil, and almost
a delusion, to extract poetic material
out of what seems embodied poetry itself
to an American. An Englishman cares
nothing about the Tower, which to us is a
haunted castle in dream-land. That honest
and excellent gentleman, the late Mr. G. P.
R. James (whose mechanical ability, one
might have supposed, would nourish itself
by devouring every old stone of such a
structure), once assured me that he had
never in his life set eyes upon the Tower,
though for years an historic novelist in
London.</p>

<p class="caption">Tower of London.</p>

<p>Not to spend a whole summer's day
upon the voyage, we will suppose ourselves
to have reached London Bridge, and thence
to have taken another steamer for a farther
passage up the river. But here the memorable
objects succeed each other so rapidly
that I can spare but a single sentence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>even for the great Dome, though I deem
it more picturesque, in that dusky atmosphere,
than St. Peter's in its clear blue sky.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
I must mention, however (since everything
connected with royalty is especially interesting
to my dear countrymen), that I once
saw a large and beautiful barge, splendidly
gilded and ornamented, and overspread with
a rich covering, lying at the pier nearest to
St. Paul's Cathedral; it had the royal banner
of Great Britain displayed, besides being
decorated with a number of other flags;
and many footmen (who are universally the
grandest and gaudiest objects to be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>in England at this day, and these were
regal ones, in a bright scarlet livery bedizened
with gold-lace, and white silk stockings)
were in attendance. I know not what
festive or ceremonial occasion may have
drawn out this pageant; after all, it might
have been merely a city-spectacle, appertaining
to the Lord Mayor; but the sight
had its value in bringing vividly before me
the grand old times when the sovereign
and nobles were accustomed to use the
Thames as the high street of the metropolis,
and join in pompous processions upon
it; whereas, the desuetude of such customs
nowadays has caused the whole show of
river-life to consist in a multitude of smoke-begrimed
steamers. An analogous change
has taken place in the streets, where cabs
and the omnibus have crowded out a rich
variety of vehicles; and thus life gets more
monotonous in hue from age to age, and appears
to seize every opportunity to strip off
a bit of its gold-lace among the wealthier
classes, and to make itself decent in the
lower ones.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> St. Paul's appeared to me unspeakably grand and
noble, and the more so from the throng and bustle
continually going on around its base, without in the least
disturbing the sublime repose of its great dome, and,
indeed, of all its massive height and breadth. Other
edifices may crowd close to its foundation, and people
may tramp as they like about it; but still the great
cathedral is as quiet and serene as if it stood in the
middle of Salisbury Plain. There cannot be anything
else in its way so good in the world as just this effect of
St. Paul's in the very heart and densest tumult of London.
I do not know whether the church is built of
marble, or of whatever other white or nearly white material;
but in the time that it has been standing there, it
has grown black with the smoke of ages, through which
there are, nevertheless, gleams of white, that make a
most picturesque impression on the whole. It is much
better than staring white; the edifice would not be
nearly so grand without this drapery of black.&mdash;II. 91.</p></div>

<p class="caption">St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral.</p>

<p>Yonder is Whitefriars, the old rowdy
Alsatia, now wearing as decorous a face
as any other portion of London; and, adjoining
it, the avenues and brick squares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>of the Temple, with that historic garden,
close upon the river-side, and still rich in
shrubbery and flowers, where the partisans
of York and Lancaster plucked the fatal
roses, and scattered their pale and bloody
petals over so many English battle-fields.
Hard by, we see the long white front or
rear of Somerset House, and, farther on,
rise the two new Houses of Parliament,
with a huge unfinished tower already hiding
its imperfect summit in the smoky
canopy,&mdash;the whole vast and cumbrous
edifice a specimen of the best that modern
architecture can effect, elaborately imitating
the masterpieces of those simple ages
when men "builded better than they
knew."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Close by it, we have a glimpse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>of the roof and upper towers of the holy
Abbey; while that gray, ancestral pile on
the opposite side of the river is Lambeth
Palace, a venerable group of halls and turrets,
chiefly built of brick, but with at
least one large tower of stone.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In our
course, we have passed beneath half a
dozen bridges, and, emerging out of the
black heart of London, shall soon reach a
cleanly suburb, where old Father Thames,
if I remember, begins to put on an aspect
of unpolluted innocence. And now we
look back upon the mass of innumerable
roofs, out of which rise steeples, towers,
columns, and the great crowning Dome,&mdash;look
back, in short, upon that mystery
of the world's proudest city, amid which
a man so longs and loves to be; not, perhaps,
because it contains much that is positively
admirable and enjoyable, but because,
at all events, the world has nothing
better. The cream of external life is there;
and whatever merely intellectual or material
good we fail to find perfect in London,
we may as well content ourselves to
seek that unattainable thing no farther on
this earth.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> After coming out of the Abbey, we looked at the two
Houses of Parliament, directly across the way,&mdash;an immense
structure, and certainly most splendid, built of a
beautiful warm-colored stone. The building has a very
elaborate finish, and delighted me at first; but by and
by I began to be sensible of a weariness in the effect, a
lack of variety in the plan and ornament, a deficiency of
invention; so that instead of being more and more interested
the longer one looks, as is the case with an old
Gothic edifice, and continually reading deeper into it,
one finds that one has seen all in seeing a little piece,
and that the magnificent palace has nothing better to
show one or to do for one. It is wonderful how the old
weather-stained and smoke-blackened Abbey shames
down this brand-newness; not that the Parliament
Houses are not fine objects to look at, too.&mdash;II. 105.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> It stands immediately on the bank of the river, not
far above the bridge. We merely walked round it, and
saw only an old stone tower or two, partially renewed
with brick, and a high connecting wall, within which appeared
gables and other portions of the palace, all of an
ancient plan and venerable aspect, though evidently
much patched up and restored in the course of the many
ages since its foundation.&mdash;II. 193.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The steamer terminates its trip at Chelsea,
an old town endowed with a prodigious
number of pothouses, and some famous
gardens, called the Cremorne, for public
amusement. The most noticeable thing,
however, is Chelsea Hospital, which, like
that of Greenwich, was founded, I believe,
by Charles II. (whose bronze statue, in the
guise of an old Roman, stands in the centre
of the quadrangle), and appropriated
as a home for aged and infirm soldiers of
the British army. The edifices are of three
stories, with windows in the high roofs,
and are built of dark, sombre brick, with
stone edgings and facings. The effect
is by no means that of grandeur (which
is somewhat disagreeably an attribute of
Greenwich Hospital), but a quiet and venerable
neatness. At each extremity of the
street-front there is a spacious and hospitably
open gateway, lounging about which
I saw some gray veterans in long scarlet
coats of an antique fashion, and the cocked
hats of a century ago, or occasionally a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
modern foraging-cap. Almost all of them
moved with a rheumatic gait, two or three
stumped on wooden legs, and here and
there an arm was missing. Inquiring of
one of these fragmentary heroes whether
a stranger could be admitted to see the
establishment, he replied most cordially,
"Oh yes, sir,&mdash;anywhere! Walk in and
go where you please,&mdash;upstairs, or anywhere!"
So I entered, and, passing along
the inner side of the quadrangle, came to
the door of the chapel, which forms a part
of the contiguity of edifices next the street.
Here another pensioner, an old warrior of
exceedingly peaceable and Christian demeanor,
touched his three-cornered hat and
asked if I wished to see the interior; to
which I assenting, he unlocked the door,
and we went in.</p>

<p>The chapel consists of a great hall with
a vaulted roof, and over the altar is a large
painting in fresco, the subject of which
I did not trouble myself to make out.
More appropriate adornments of the place,
dedicated as well to martial reminiscences
as religious worship, are the long ranges
of dusty and tattered banners, that hang
from their staves all round the ceiling of
the chapel. They are trophies of battles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
fought and won in every quarter of the
world, comprising the captured flags of all
the nations with whom the British lion
has waged war since James II.'s time,&mdash;French,
Dutch, East Indian, Prussian, Russian,
Chinese, and American,&mdash;collected
together in this consecrated spot, not to
symbolize that there shall be no more discord
upon earth, but drooping over the
aisle in sullen, though peaceable, humiliation.
Yes, I said "American" among
the rest; for the good old pensioner mistook
me for an Englishman, and failed not
to point out (and, methought, with an especial
emphasis of triumph) some flags
that had been taken at Bladensburg and
Washington. I fancied, indeed, that they
hung a little higher and drooped a little
lower than any of their companions in disgrace.
It is a comfort, however, that their
proud devices are already indistinguishable,
or nearly so, owing to dust and tatters
and the kind offices of the moths, and
that they will soon rot from the banner-staves
and be swept out in unrecognized
fragments from the chapel-door.</p>

<p>It is a good method of teaching a man
how imperfectly cosmopolitan he is, to
show him his country's flag occupying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
position of dishonor in a foreign land. But,
in truth, the whole system of a people
crowing over its military triumphs had far
better be dispensed with, both on account
of the ill-blood that it helps to keep fermenting
among the nations, and because
it operates as an accumulative inducement
to future generations to aim at a kind of
glory, the gain of which has generally
proved more ruinous than its loss. I heartily
wish that every trophy of victory might
crumble away, and that every reminiscence
or tradition of a hero, from the beginning
of the world to this day, could pass out of
all men's memories at once and forever.
I might feel very differently, to be sure, if
we Northerners had anything especially
valuable to lose by the fading of those illuminated
names.</p>

<p>I gave the pensioner (but I am afraid
there may have been a little affectation in
it) a magnificent guerdon of all the silver
I had in my pocket, to requite him for
having unintentionally stirred up my patriotic
susceptibilities. He was a meek-looking,
kindly old man, with a humble
freedom and affability of manner that made
it pleasant to converse with him. Old soldiers,
I know not why, seem to be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
accostable than old sailors. One is apt to
hear a growl beneath the smoothest courtesy
of the latter. The mild veteran, with
his peaceful voice, and gentle reverend
aspect, told me that he had fought at a
cannon all through the Battle of Waterloo,
and escaped unhurt; he had now been in
the hospital four or five years, and was
married, but necessarily underwent a separation
from his wife, who lived outside
of the gates. To my inquiry whether his
fellow-pensioners were comfortable and
happy, he answered, with great alacrity,
"Oh yes, sir!" qualifying his evidence,
after a moment's consideration, by saying
in an undertone, "There are some people,
your Honor knows, who could not be comfortable
anywhere." I did know it, and
fear that the system of Chelsea Hospital
allows too little of that wholesome care
and regulation of their own occupations
and interests which might assuage the
sting of life to those naturally uncomfortable
individuals by giving them something
external to think about. But my old friend
here was happy in the hospital, and by this
time, very likely, is happy in heaven, in
spite of the bloodshed that he may have
caused by touching off a cannon at Waterloo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>Crossing Battersea Bridge, in the neighborhood
of Chelsea, I remember seeing a
distant gleam of the Crystal Palace, glimmering
afar in the afternoon sunshine like
an imaginary structure,&mdash;an air-castle by
chance descended upon earth, and resting
there one instant before it vanished, as we
sometimes see a soap-bubble touch unharmed
on the carpet,&mdash;a thing of only
momentary visibility and no substance,
destined to be overburdened and crushed
down by the first cloud-shadow that might
fall upon that spot. Even as I looked, it
disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Shall I attempt a picture of
this exhalation of modern ingenuity, or
what else shall I try to paint? Everything
in London and its vicinity has been depicted
innumerable times, but never once translated
into intelligible images; it is an "old,
old story," never yet told, nor to be told.
While writing these reminiscences, I am
continually impressed with the futility of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>the effort to give any creative truth to my
sketch, so that it might produce such pictures
in the reader's mind as would cause
the original scenes to appear familiar when
afterwards beheld. Nor have other writers
often been more successful in representing
definite objects prophetically to my own
mind. In truth, I believe that the chief
delight and advantage of this kind of literature
is not for any real information that
it supplies to untraveled people, but for
reviving the recollections and reawakening
the emotions of persons already acquainted
with the scenes described. Thus I found
an exquisite pleasure, the other day, in
reading Mr. Tuckerman's "Month in England,"&mdash;a
fine example of the way in
which a refined and cultivated American
looks at the Old Country, the things that
he naturally seeks there, and the modes of
feeling and reflection which they excite.
Correct outlines avail little or nothing,
though truth of coloring may be somewhat
more efficacious. Impressions, however,
states of mind produced by interesting and
remarkable objects, these, if truthfully and
vividly recorded, may work a genuine effect,
and, though but the result of what we see,
go further towards representing the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
scene than any direct effort to paint it.
Give the emotions that cluster about it,
and, without being able to analyze the spell
by which it is summoned up, you get something
like a simulachre of the object in the
midst of them. From some of the above
reflections I draw the comfortable inference,
that, the longer and better known a
thing may be, so much the more eligible is
it as the subject of a descriptive sketch.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The Crystal Palace gleamed in the sunshine; but I
do not think a very impressive edifice can be built of
glass,&mdash;light and airy, to be sure, but still it will be no
other than an overgrown conservatory. It is unlike
anything else in England; uncongenial with the English
character, without privacy, destitute of mass, weight, and
shadow, unsusceptible of ivy, lichens, or any mellowness
from age.&mdash;II. 135.</p></div>

<p>On a Sunday afternoon, I passed through
a side-entrance in the time-blackened wall
of a place of worship, and found myself
among a congregation assembled in one of
the transepts and the immediately contiguous
portion of the nave. It was a vast
old edifice, spacious enough, within the extent
covered by its pillared roof and overspread
by its stone pavement, to accommodate
the whole of church-going London,
and with a far wider and loftier concave
than any human power of lungs could fill
with audible prayer. Oaken benches were
arranged in the transept, on one of which
I seated myself, and joined, as well as I
knew how, in the sacred business that was
going forward. But when it came to the
sermon, the voice of the preacher was
puny, and so were his thoughts, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
seemed impertinent at such a time and
place, where he and all of us were bodily
included within a sublime act of religion,
which could be seen above and around us
and felt beneath our feet. The structure
itself was the worship of the devout men
of long ago, miraculously preserved in stone
without losing an atom of its fragrance
and fervor; it was a kind of anthem-strain
that they had sung and poured out of the
organ in centuries gone by; and being so
grand and sweet, the Divine benevolence
had willed it to be prolonged for the behoof
of auditors unborn. I therefore came to
the conclusion, that, in my individual case,
it would be better and more reverent to
let my eyes wander about the edifice than
to fasten them and my thoughts on the
evidently uninspired mortal who was venturing&mdash;and
felt it no venture at all&mdash;to
speak here above his breath.</p>

<p>The interior of Westminster Abbey (for
the reader recognized it, no doubt, the
moment we entered) is built of rich brown
stone; and the whole of it&mdash;the lofty roof,
the tall, clustered pillars, and the pointed
arches&mdash;appears to be in consummate repair.
At all points where decay has laid
its finger, the structure is clamped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
iron or otherwise carefully protected; and
being thus watched over,&mdash;whether as a
place of ancient sanctity, a noble specimen
of Gothic art, or an object of national interest
and pride,&mdash;it may reasonably be expected
to survive for as many ages as have
passed over it already. It was sweet to
feel its venerable quietude, its long-enduring
peace, and yet to observe how kindly
and even cheerfully it received the sunshine
of to-day, which fell from the great
windows into the fretted aisles and arches
that laid aside somewhat of their aged
gloom to welcome it. Sunshine always
seems friendly to old abbeys, churches, and
castles, kissing them, as it were, with a
more affectionate, though still reverential
familiarity, than it accords to edifices of
later date. A square of golden light lay
on the sombre pavement of the nave, afar
off, falling through the grand western entrance,
the folding leaves of which were
wide open, and afforded glimpses of people
passing to and fro in the outer world, while
we sat dimly enveloped in the solemnity of
antique devotion. In the south transept,
separated from us by the full breadth of
the minster, there were painted glass windows,
of which the uppermost appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
be a great orb of many-colored radiance,
being, indeed, a cluster of saints and angels
whose glorified bodies formed the rays of
an aureole emanating from a cross in the
midst. These windows are modern, but
combine softness with wonderful brilliancy
of effect. Through the pillars and arches,
I saw that the walls in that distant region
of the edifice were almost wholly incrusted
with marble, now grown yellow with time,
no blank, unlettered slabs, but memorials
of such men as their respective generations
deemed wisest and bravest. Some of them
were commemorated merely by inscriptions
on mural tablets, others by sculptured bas-reliefs,
others (once famous, but now forgotten,
generals or admirals, these) by
ponderous tombs that aspired towards the
roof of the aisle, or partly curtained the
immense arch of a window. These mountains
of marble were peopled with the
sisterhood of Allegory, winged trumpeters,
and classic figures in full-bottomed wigs;
but it was strange to observe how the old
Abbey melted all such absurdities into the
breadth of its own grandeur, even magnifying
itself by what would elsewhere have
been ridiculous. Methinks it is the test
of Gothic sublimity to overpower the ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
without deigning to hide it; and
these grotesque monuments of the last
century answer a similar purpose with the
grinning faces which the old architects
scattered among their most solemn conceptions.</p>

<p>From these distant wanderings (it was
my first visit to Westminster Abbey, and
I would gladly have taken it all in at a
glance) my eyes came back and began to
investigate what was immediately about
me in the transept. Close at my elbow
was the pedestal of Canning's statue. Next
beyond it was a massive tomb, on the spacious
tablet of which reposed the full-length
figures of a marble lord and lady,
whom an inscription announced to be the
Duke and Duchess of Newcastle,&mdash;the
historic Duke of Charles I.'s time, and the
fantastic Duchess, traditionally remembered
by her poems and plays. She was of a
family, as the record on her tomb proudly
informed us, of which all the brothers had
been valiant and all the sisters virtuous.
A recent statue of Sir John Malcolm, the
new marble as white as snow, held the
next place; and near by was a mural monument
and bust of Sir Peter Warren. The
round visage of this old British admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
has a certain interest for a New-Englander,
because it was by no merit of his own
(though he took care to assume it as such),
but by the valor and warlike enterprise
of our colonial forefathers, especially the
stout men of Massachusetts, that he won
rank and renown, and a tomb in Westminster
Abbey. Lord Mansfield, a huge
mass of marble done into the guise of a
judicial gown and wig, with a stern face in
the midst of the latter, sat on the other
side of the transept; and on the pedestal
beside him was a figure of Justice, holding
forth, instead of the customary grocer's
scales, an actual pair of brass steelyards.
It is an ancient and classic instrument, undoubtedly;
but I had supposed that Portia
(when Shylock's pound of flesh was to be
weighed) was the only judge that ever
really called for it in a court of justice.
Pitt and Fox were in the same distinguished
company; and John Kemble, in
Roman costume, stood not far off, but
strangely shorn of the dignity that is said
to have enveloped him like a mantle in his
lifetime. Perhaps the evanescent majesty
of the stage is incompatible with the long
endurance of marble and the solemn reality
of the tomb; though, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
almost every illustrious personage here represented
has been invested with more or
less of stage-trickery by his sculptor. In
truth, the artist (unless there be a divine
efficacy in his touch, making evident a
heretofore hidden dignity in the actual
form) feels it an imperious law to remove
his subject as far from the aspect of ordinary
life as may be possible without sacrificing
every trace of resemblance. The
absurd effect of the contrary course is very
remarkable in the statue of Mr. Wilberforce,
whose actual self, save for the lack
of color, I seemed to behold, seated just
across the aisle.</p>

<p>This excellent man appears to have sunk
into himself in a sitting posture, with a
thin leg crossed over his knee, a book in
one hand, and a finger of the other under
his chin, I believe, or applied to the side
of his nose, or to some equally familiar
purpose; while his exceedingly homely and
wrinkled face, held a little on one side,
twinkles at you with the shrewdest complacency,
as if he were looking right into
your eyes, and twigged something there
which you had half a mind to conceal
from him. He keeps this look so pertinaciously
that you feel it to be insufferably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
impertinent, and bethink yourself what
common ground there may be between
yourself and a stone image, enabling you
to resent it. I have no doubt that the
statue is as like Mr. Wilberforce as one
pea to another, and you might fancy, that,
at some ordinary moment, when he least
expected it, and before he had time to
smooth away his knowing complication of
wrinkles, he had seen the Gorgon's head,
and whitened into marble,&mdash;not only his
personal self, but his coat and small-clothes,
down to a button and the minutest crease
of the cloth. The ludicrous result marks
the impropriety of bestowing the age-long
duration of marble upon small, characteristic
individualities, such as might come
within the province of waxen imagery.
The sculptor should give permanence to
the figure of a great man in his mood of
broad and grand composure, which would
obliterate all mean peculiarities; for, if
the original were unaccustomed to such a
mood, or if his features were incapable of
assuming the guise, it seems questionable
whether he could really have been entitled
to a marble immortality. In point of fact,
however, the English face and form are
seldom statuesque, however illustrious the
individual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>It ill becomes me, perhaps, to have lapsed
into this mood of half-jocose criticism in
describing my first visit to Westminster
Abbey, a spot which I had dreamed about
more reverentially, from my childhood upward,
than any other in the world, and
which I then beheld, and now look back
upon, with profound gratitude to the men
who built it, and a kindly interest, I may
add, in the humblest personage that has
contributed his little all to its impressiveness,
by depositing his dust or his memory
there. But it is a characteristic of this
grand edifice that it permits you to smile
as freely under the roof of its central nave
as if you stood beneath the yet grander
canopy of heaven. Break into laughter, if
you feel inclined, provided the vergers do
not hear it echoing among the arches. In
an ordinary church you would keep your
countenance for fear of disturbing the
sanctities or proprieties of the place; but
you need leave no honest and decorous
portion of your human nature outside of
these benign and truly hospitable walls.
Their mild awfulness will take care of itself.
Thus it does no harm to the general
impression, when you come to be sensible
that many of the monuments are ridiculous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and commemorate a mob of people who
are mostly forgotten in their graves, and
few of whom ever deserved any better
boon from posterity. You acknowledge
the force of Sir Godfrey Kneller's objection
to being buried in Westminster Abbey,
because "they do bury fools there!"
Nevertheless, these grotesque carvings
of marble, that break out in dingy-white
blotches on the old freestone of the interior
walls, have come there by as natural a
process as might cause mosses and ivy to
cluster about the external edifice; for they
are the historical and biographical record
of each successive age, written with its
own hand, and all the truer for the inevitable
mistakes, and none the less solemn
for the occasional absurdity. Though you
entered the Abbey expecting to see the
tombs only of the illustrious, you are content
at last to read many names, both in
literature and history, that have now lost
the reverence of mankind, if indeed they
ever really possessed it. Let these men
rest in peace. Even if you miss a name
or two that you hoped to find there, they
may well be spared. It matters little a
few more or less, or whether Westminster
Abbey contains or lacks any one man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
grave, so long as the Centuries, each with
the crowd of personages that it deemed
memorable, have chosen it as their place
of honored sepulture, and laid themselves
down under its pavement. The inscriptions
and devices on the walls are rich
with evidences of the fluctuating tastes,
fashions, manners, opinions, prejudices,
follies, wisdoms, of the past, and thus they
combine into a more truthful memorial of
their dead times than any individual epitaph-maker
ever meant to write.</p>

<p>When the services were over, many of
the audience seemed inclined to linger in
the nave or wander away among the mysterious
aisles; for there is nothing in this
world so fascinating as a Gothic minster,
which always invites you deeper and deeper
into its heart both by vast revelations and
shadowy concealments. Through the open-work
screen that divides the nave from
the chancel and choir, we could discern
the gleam of a marvelous window, but
were debarred from entrance into that
more sacred precinct of the Abbey by the
vergers. These vigilant officials (doing
their duty all the more strenuously because
no fees could be exacted from Sunday
visitors) flourished their staves, and drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
us towards the grand entrance like a flock
of sheep. Lingering through one of the
aisles, I happened to look down, and found
my foot upon a stone inscribed with this
familiar exclamation, "<i>O rare Ben Jonson!</i>"
and remembered the story of stout old
Ben's burial in that spot, standing upright,&mdash;not,
I presume, on account of any unseemly
reluctance on his part to lie down
in the dust, like other men, but because
standing-room was all that could reasonably
be demanded for a poet among the
slumberous notabilities of his age. It made
me weary to think of it!&mdash;such a prodigious
length of time to keep one's feet!&mdash;apart
from the honor of the thing, it
would certainly have been better for Ben
to stretch himself at ease in some country
churchyard. To this day, however, I fancy
that there is a contemptuous alloy mixed
up with the admiration which the higher
classes of English society profess for their
literary men.</p>

<p>Another day&mdash;in truth, many other
days&mdash;I sought out Poets' Corner, and
found a sign-board and pointed finger
directing the visitor to it, on the corner
house of a little lane leading towards the
rear of the Abbey. The entrance is at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
southeastern end of the south transept, and
it is used, on ordinary occasions, as the
only free mode of access to the building.
It is no spacious arch, but a small, lowly
door, passing through which, and pushing
aside an inner screen that partly keeps out
an exceedingly chill wind, you find yourself
in a dim nook of the Abbey, with the busts
of poets gazing at you from the otherwise
bare stone-work of the walls. Great poets,
too; for Ben Jonson is right behind the
door, and Spenser's tablet is next, and
Butler's on the same side of the transept,
and Milton's (whose bust you know at once
by its resemblance to one of his portraits,
though older, more wrinkled, and sadder
than that) is close by, and a profile-medallion
of Gray beneath it. A window high
aloft sheds down a dusky daylight on these
and many other sculptured marbles, now
as yellow as old parchment, that cover the
three walls of the nook up to an elevation
of about twenty feet above the pavement.
It seemed to me that I had always been
familiar with the spot. Enjoying a humble
intimacy&mdash;and how much of my life had
else been a dreary solitude!&mdash;with many
of its inhabitants, I could not feel myself
a stranger there. It was delightful to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>among them. There was a genial awe,
mingled with a sense of kind and friendly
presences about me; and I was glad, moreover,
at finding so many of them there
together, in fit companionship, mutually
recognized and duly honored, all reconciled
now, whatever distant generations, whatever
personal hostility or other miserable
impediment, had divided them far asunder
while they lived. I have never felt a
similar interest in any other tombstones,
nor have I ever been deeply moved by the
imaginary presence of other famous dead
people. A poet's ghost is the only one
that survives for his fellow-mortals, after
his bones are in the dust,&mdash;and he not
ghostly, but cherishing many hearts with
his own warmth in the chillest atmosphere
of life. What other fame is worth aspiring
for? Or, let me speak it more boldly,
what other long-enduring fame can exist?
We neither remember nor care anything
for the past, except as the poet has made
it intelligibly noble and sublime to our
comprehension. The shades of the mighty
have no substance; they flit ineffectually
about the darkened stage where they performed
their momentary parts, save when
the poet has thrown his own creative soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
into them, and imparted a more vivid life
than ever they were able to manifest to
mankind while they dwelt in the body.
And therefore&mdash;though he cunningly disguises
himself in their armor, their robes
of state, or kingly purple&mdash;it is not the
statesman, the warrior, or the monarch
that survives, but the despised poet, whom
they may have fed with their crumbs, and
to whom they owe all that they now are or
have,&mdash;a name!<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> <i>September 30, 1855.</i> Poets' Corner has never seemed
like a strange place to me; it has been familiar from the
very first; at all events, I cannot now recollect the previous
conception, of which the reality has taken the place.
I seem always to have known that somewhat dim
corner, with the bare brown stone-work of the old edifice
aloft, and a window shedding down its light on the
marble busts and tablets, yellow with time, that cover
the three walls of the nook up to a height of about
twenty feet. Prior's is the largest and richest monument.
It is observable that the bust and monument of
Congreve are in a distant part of the Abbey. His
duchess probably thought it a degradation to bring a
gentleman among the beggarly poets.&mdash;II. 153.
</p>

<p><i>November 12, 1857.</i> We found our way to Poets' Corner,
however, and entered those holy precincts, which
looked very dusky and grim in the smoky light.... I
was strongly impressed with the perception that very
commonplace people compose the great bulk of society
in the home of the illustrious dead. It is wonderful
how few names there are that one cares anything about
a hundred years after their departure; but perhaps each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>generation acts in good faith in canonizing its own
men.... But the fame of the buried person does not
make the marble live,&mdash;the marble keeps merely a cold
and sad memory of a man who would else be forgotten.
No man who needs a monument ever ought to have
one.&mdash;II. 565.</p></div>

<p class="caption">Poets&#39; Corner, Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>In the foregoing paragraph I seem to
have been betrayed into a flight above
or beyond the customary level that best
agrees with me; but it represents fairly
enough the emotions with which I passed
from Poets' Corner into the chapels, which
contain the sepulchres of kings and great
people. They are magnificent even now,
and must have been inconceivably so when
the marble slabs and pillars wore their new
polish, and the statues retained the brilliant
colors with which they were originally
painted, and the shrines their rich gilding,
of which the sunlight still shows a glimmer
or a streak, though the sunbeam itself looks
tarnished with antique dust. Yet this recondite
portion of the Abbey presents few
memorials of personages whom we care
to remember. The shrine of Edward the
Confessor has a certain interest, because
it was so long held in religious reverence,
and because the very dust that settled
upon it was formerly worth gold. The
helmet and war-saddle of Henry V., worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>at Agincourt, and now suspended above
his tomb, are memorable objects, but more
for Shakespeare's sake than the victor's
own. Rank has been the general passport
to admission here. Noble and regal
dust is as cheap as dirt under the pavement.
I am glad to recollect, indeed (and
it is too characteristic of the right English
spirit not to be mentioned), one or
two gigantic statues of great mechanicians,
who contributed largely to the material
welfare of England, sitting familiarly in
their marble chairs among forgotten kings
and queens. Otherwise, the quaintness of
the earlier monuments, and the antique
beauty of some of them, are what chiefly
gives them value. Nevertheless, Addison
is buried among the men of rank; not on
the plea of his literary fame, however, but
because he was connected with nobility by
marriage, and had been a Secretary of
State. His gravestone is inscribed with a
resounding verse from Tickell's lines to
his memory, the only lines by which Tickell
himself is now remembered, and which
(as I discovered a little while ago) he
mainly filched from an obscure versifier of
somewhat earlier date.</p>

<p>Returning to Poets' Corner, I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
again at the walls, and wondered how the
requisite hospitality can be shown to poets
of our own and the succeeding ages. There
is hardly a foot of space left, although
room has lately been found for a bust of
Southey and a full-length statue of Campbell.
At best, only a little portion of the
Abbey is dedicated to poets, literary men,
musical composers, and others of the gentle
artist breed, and even into that small
nook of sanctity men of other pursuits have
thought it decent to intrude themselves.
Methinks the tuneful throng, being at
home here, should recollect how they were
treated in their lifetime, and turn the cold
shoulder, looking askance at nobles and
official personages, however worthy of
honorable interment elsewhere. Yet it
shows aptly and truly enough what portion
of the world's regard and honor has heretofore
been awarded to literary eminence in
comparison with other modes of greatness,&mdash;this
dimly lighted corner (nor even that
quietly to themselves) in the vast minster
the walls of which are sheathed and hidden
under marble that has been wasted upon
the illustrious obscure. Nevertheless, it
may not be worth while to quarrel with the
world on this account; for, to confess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
very truth, their own little nook contains
more than one poet whose memory is kept
alive by his monument, instead of imbuing
the senseless stone with a spiritual immortality,&mdash;men
of whom you do not ask,
"Where is he?" but, "Why is he here?"
I estimate that all the literary people who
really make an essential part of one's inner
life, including the period since English
literature first existed, might have ample
elbow-room to sit down and quaff their
draughts of Castaly round Chaucer's broad,
horizontal tombstone. These divinest poets
consecrate the spot, and throw a reflected
glory over the humblest of their companions.
And as for the latter, it is to be
hoped that they may have long outgrown
the characteristic jealousies and morbid
sensibilities of their craft, and have found
out the little value (probably not amounting
to sixpence in immortal currency) of
the posthumous renown which they once
aspired to win. It would be a poor compliment
to a dead poet to fancy him leaning
out of the sky and snuffing up the impure
breath of earthly praise.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot easily rid ourselves of
the notion that those who have bequeathed
us the inheritance of an undying song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
would fain be conscious of its endless
reverberations in the hearts of mankind,
and would delight, among sublimer enjoyments,
to see their names emblazoned in
such a treasure-place of great memories
as Westminster Abbey. There are some
men, at all events,&mdash;true and tender poets,
moreover, and fully deserving of the honor,&mdash;whose
spirits, I feel certain, would linger
a little while about Poets' Corner, for the
sake of witnessing their own apotheosis
among their kindred. They have had a
strong natural yearning, not so much for
applause as sympathy, which the cold fortune
of their lifetime did but scantily supply;
so that this unsatisfied appetite may
make itself felt upon sensibilities at once
so delicate and retentive, even a step or
two beyond the grave. Leigh Hunt, for
example, would be pleased, even now, if he
could learn that his bust had been reposited
in the midst of the old poets whom he admired
and loved; though there is hardly a
man among the authors of to-day and yesterday
whom the judgment of Englishmen
would be less likely to place there. He
deserves it, however, if not for his verse
(the value of which I do not estimate,
never having been able to read it), yet for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
his delightful prose, his unmeasured poetry,
the inscrutable happiness of his touch,
working soft miracles by a life-process like
the growth of grass and flowers. As with
all such gentle writers, his page sometimes
betrayed a vestige of affectation, but, the
next moment, a rich, natural luxuriance
overgrew and buried it out of sight. I
knew him a little, and (since, Heaven be
praised, few English celebrities whom I
chanced to meet have enfranchised my pen
by their decease, and as I assume no liberties
with living men) I will conclude this
rambling article by sketching my first interview
with Leigh Hunt.</p>

<p>He was then at Hammersmith, occupying
a very plain and shabby little house, in
a contiguous range of others like it, with
no prospect but that of an ugly village
street, and certainly nothing to gratify his
craving for a tasteful environment, inside
or out. A slatternly maid-servant opened
the door for us, and he himself stood in
the entry, a beautiful and venerable old
man, buttoned to the chin in a black dress-coat,
tall and slender, with a countenance
quietly alive all over, and the gentlest and
most naturally courteous manner. He
ushered us into his little study, or parlor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
or both,&mdash;a very forlorn room, with poor
paper-hangings and carpet, few books, no
pictures that I remember, and an awful
lack of upholstery. I touch distinctly upon
these external blemishes and this nudity of
adornment, not that they would be worth
mentioning in a sketch of other remarkable
persons, but because Leigh Hunt was born
with such a faculty of enjoying all beautiful
things that it seemed as if Fortune did
him as much wrong in not supplying them
as in withholding a sufficiency of vital
breath from ordinary men. All kinds of
mild magnificence, tempered by his taste,
would have become him well; but he had
not the grim dignity that assumes nakedness
as the better robe.</p>

<p>I have said that he was a beautiful old
man. In truth, I never saw a finer countenance,
either as to the mould of features
or the expression, nor any that showed the
play of feeling so perfectly without the
slightest theatrical emphasis. It was like
a child's face in this respect. At my first
glimpse of him, when he met us in the
entry, I discerned that he was old, his long
hair being white and his wrinkles many;
it was an aged visage, in short, such as I
had not at all expected to see, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
dates, because his books talk to the reader
with the tender vivacity of youth. But
when he began to speak, and as he grew
more earnest in conversation, I ceased to
be sensible of his age; sometimes, indeed,
its dusky shadow darkened through the
gleam which his sprightly thoughts diffused
about his face, but then another
flash of youth came out of his eyes and
made an illumination again. I never witnessed
such a wonderfully illusive transformation,
before or since; and, to this
day, trusting only to my recollection, I
should find it difficult to decide which was
his genuine and stable predicament,&mdash;youth
or age. I have met no Englishman
whose manners seemed to me so agreeable,
soft, rather than polished, wholly unconventional,
the natural growth of a kindly
and sensitive disposition without any reference
to rule, or else obedient to some rule
so subtile that the nicest observer could
not detect the application of it.</p>

<p>His eyes were dark and very fine, and
his delightful voice accompanied their visible
language like music. He appeared to
be exceedingly appreciative of whatever
was passing among those who surrounded
him, and especially of the vicissitudes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
the consciousness of the person to whom
he happened to be addressing himself at
the moment. I felt that no effect upon
my mind of what he uttered, no emotion,
however transitory, in myself, escaped his
notice, though not from any positive vigilance
on his part, but because his faculty of
observation was so penetrative and delicate;
and to say the truth, it a little confused me
to discern always a ripple on his mobile
face, responsive to any slightest breeze that
passed over the inner reservoir of my sentiments,
and seemed thence to extend to a
similar reservoir within himself. On matters
of feeling, and within a certain depth,
you might spare yourself the trouble of
utterance, because he already knew what
you wanted to say, and perhaps a little
more than you would have spoken. His
figure was full of gentle movement, though,
somehow, without disturbing its quietude;
and as he talked, he kept folding his hands
nervously, and betokened in many ways a
fine and immediate sensibility, quick to feel
pleasure or pain, though scarcely capable,
I should imagine, of a passionate experience
in either direction. There was not
an English trait in him from head to foot,
morally, intellectually, or physically. Beef,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
ale, or stout, brandy or port-wine, entered
not at all into his composition. In his
earlier life, he appears to have given evidences
of courage and sturdy principle, and
of a tendency to fling himself into the
rough struggle of humanity on the liberal
side. It would be taking too much upon
myself to affirm that this was merely a
projection of his fancy world into the actual,
and that he never could have hit a
downright blow, and was altogether an unsuitable
person to receive one. I beheld
him not in his armor, but in his peacefulest
robes. Nevertheless, drawing my conclusion
merely from what I saw, it would have
occurred to me that his main deficiency
was a lack of grit. Though anything but
a timid man, the combative and defensive
elements were not prominently developed
in his character, and could have been made
available only when he put an unnatural
force upon his instincts. It was on this
account, and also because of the fineness
of his nature generally, that the English
appreciated him no better, and left this
sweet and delicate poet poor, and with
scanty laurels, in his declining age.</p>

<p>It was not, I think, from his American
blood that Leigh Hunt derived either his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
amiability or his peaceful inclinations; at
least, I do not see how we can reasonably
claim the former quality as a national characteristic,
though the latter might have
been fairly inherited from his ancestors on
the mother's side, who were Pennsylvania
Quakers. But the kind of excellence that
distinguished him&mdash;his fineness, subtilty,
and grace&mdash;was that which the richest
cultivation has heretofore tended to develop
in the happier examples of American
genius, and which (though I say it a little
reluctantly) is perhaps what our future intellectual
advancement may make general
among us. His person, at all events, was
thoroughly American, and of the best type,
as were likewise his manners; for we are
the best as well as the worst mannered
people in the world.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt loved dearly to be praised.
That is to say, he desired sympathy as a
flower seeks sunshine, and perhaps profited
by it as much in the richer depth of coloring
that it imparted to his ideas. In response
to all that we ventured to express
about his writings (and, for my part, I went
quite to the extent of my conscience, which
was a long way, and there left the matter
to a lady and a young girl, who happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
were with me), his face shone, and he manifested
great delight, with a perfect, and
yet delicate, frankness, for which I loved
him. He could not tell us, he said, the
happiness that such appreciation gave him;
it always took him by surprise, he remarked,
for&mdash;perhaps because he cleaned
his own boots, and performed other little
ordinary offices for himself&mdash;he never had
been conscious of anything wonderful in
his own person. And then he smiled,
making himself and all the poor little parlor
about him beautiful thereby. It is usually
the hardest thing in the world to praise a
man to his face; but Leigh Hunt received
the incense with such gracious satisfaction
(feeling it to be sympathy, not vulgar
praise), that the only difficulty was to keep
the enthusiasm of the moment within the
limit of permanent opinion. A storm had
suddenly come up while we were talking;
the rain poured, the lightning flashed, and
the thunder broke; but I hope, and have
great pleasure in believing, that it was a
sunny hour for Leigh Hunt. Nevertheless,
it was not to my voice that he most favorably
inclined his ear, but to those of my
companions. Women are the fit ministers
at such a shrine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>He must have suffered keenly in his
lifetime, and enjoyed keenly, keeping his
emotions so much upon the surface as he
seemed to do, and convenient for everybody
to play upon. Being of a cheerful temperament,
happiness had probably the upper-hand.
His was a light, mildly joyous
nature, gentle, graceful, yet seldom attaining
to that deepest grace which results
from power; for beauty, like woman, its
human representative, dallies with the
gentle, but yields its consummate favor
only to the strong. I imagine that Leigh
Hunt may have been more beautiful when
I met him, both in person and character,
than in his earlier days. As a young man,
I could conceive of his being finical in
certain moods, but not now, when the
gravity of age shed a venerable grace about
him. I rejoiced to hear him say that he
was favored with most confident and cheering
anticipations in respect to a future life;
and there were abundant proofs, throughout
our interview, of an unrepining spirit,
resignation, quiet relinquishment of the
worldly benefits that were denied him,
thankful enjoyment of whatever he had to
enjoy, and piety, and hope shining onward
into the dusk,&mdash;all of which gave a reverential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
cast to the feeling with which we
parted from him. I wish that he could
have had one full draught of prosperity
before he died. As a matter of artistic
propriety, it would have been delightful to
see him inhabiting a beautiful house of his
own, in an Italian climate, with all sorts of
elaborate upholstery and minute elegances
about him, and a succession of tender and
lovely women to praise his sweet poetry
from morning to night. I hardly know
whether it is my fault, or the effect of a
weakness in Leigh Hunt's character, that
I should be sensible of a regret of this
nature, when, at the same time, I sincerely
believe that he has found an infinity of
better things in the world whither he has
gone.</p>

<p>At our leave-taking he grasped me
warmly by both hands, and seemed as much
interested in our whole party as if he had
known us for years. All this was genuine
feeling, a quick, luxuriant growth out of
his heart, which was a soil for flower-seeds
of rich and rare varieties, not acorns, but
a true heart, nevertheless. Several years
afterwards I met him for the last time at a
London dinner-party, looking sadly broken
down by infirmities; and my final recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
of the beautiful old man presents him
arm in arm with, nay, if I mistake not,
partly embraced and supported by, another
beloved and honored poet, whose minstrel-name,
since he has a week-day one for his
personal occasions, I will venture to speak.
It was Barry Cornwall, whose kind introduction
had first made me known to Leigh
Hunt.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Barry Cornwall, Mr. Procter, called on me a week
or more ago, but I happened not to be in the office.
Saturday last he called again, and as I had crossed to
Rock Park he followed me thither. A plain, middle-sized,
English-looking gentleman, elderly, with short
white hair, and particularly quiet in his manners. He
talks in a somewhat low tone without emphasis, scarcely
distinct.... His head has a good outline, and would
look well in marble. I liked him very well. He talked
unaffectedly, showing an author's regard to his reputation,
and was evidently pleased to hear of his American
celebrity. He said that in his younger days he was a scientific
pugilist, and once took a journey to have a sparring
encounter with the Game-Chicken. Certainly no
one would have looked for a pugilist in this subdued
old gentleman. He is now Commissioner of Lunacy,
and makes periodical circuits through the country, attending
to the business of his office. He is slightly deaf,
and this may be the cause of his unaccented utterance,&mdash;owing
to his not being able to regulate his voice exactly
by his own ear.... He is a good man, and much
better expressed by his real name, Procter, than by his
poetical one, Barry Cornwall.... He took my hand in
both of his at parting....&mdash;I. 498.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p></div>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI.</h2>

<p class="h3">OUTSIDE GLIMPSES OF ENGLISH POVERTY</p>

<p>Becoming an inhabitant of a great English
town, I often turned aside from the
prosperous thoroughfares (where the edifices,
the shops, and the bustling crowd
differed not so much from scenes with
which I was familiar in my own country),
and went designedly astray among precincts
that reminded me of some of Dickens's
grimiest pages. There I caught
glimpses of a people and a mode of life
that were comparatively new to my observation,
a sort of sombre phantasmagoric
spectacle, exceedingly undelightful to behold,
yet involving a singular interest and
even fascination in its ugliness.</p>

<p>Dirt, one would fancy, is plenty enough
all over the world, being the symbolic accompaniment
of the foul incrustation which
began to settle over and bedim all earthly
things as soon as Eve had bitten the apple;
ever since which hapless epoch, her daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
have chiefly been engaged in a desperate
and unavailing struggle to get rid of
it. But the dirt of a poverty-stricken English
street is a monstrosity unknown on
our side of the Atlantic. It reigns supreme
within its own limits, and is inconceivable
everywhere beyond them. We enjoy the
great advantage, that the brightness and
dryness of our atmosphere keep everything
clean that the sun shines upon, converting
the larger portion of our impurities
into transitory dust which the next wind
can sweep away, in contrast with the damp,
adhesive grime that incorporates itself with
all surfaces (unless continually and painfully
cleansed) in the chill moisture of the
English air. Then the all-pervading smoke
of the city, abundantly intermingled with
the sable snow-flakes of bituminous coal,
hovering overhead, descending, and alighting
on pavements and rich architectural
fronts, on the snowy muslin of the ladies,
and the gentlemen's starched collars and
shirt-bosoms, invests even the better streets
in a half-mourning garb. It is beyond the
resources of Wealth to keep the smut away
from its premises or its own fingers' ends;
and as for Poverty, it surrenders itself to
the dark influence without a struggle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
Along with disastrous circumstances, pinching
need, adversity so lengthened out as
to constitute the rule of life, there comes
a certain chill depression of the spirits
which seems especially to shudder at cold
water. In view of so wretched a state of
things, we accept the ancient Deluge not
merely as an insulated phenomenon, but
as a periodical necessity, and acknowledge
that nothing less than such a general washing-day
could suffice to cleanse the slovenly
old world of its moral and material dirt.</p>

<p>Gin-shops, or what the English call
spirit-vaults, are numerous in the vicinity
of these poor streets, and are set off with
the magnificence of gilded door-posts, tarnished
by contact with the unclean customers
who haunt there. Ragged children
come thither with old shaving-mugs,
or broken-nosed teapots, or any such make-shift
receptacle, to get a little poison or
madness for their parents, who deserve no
better requital at their hands for having
engendered them. Inconceivably sluttish
women enter at noonday and stand at the
counter among boon-companions of both
sexes, stirring up misery and jollity in a
bumper together, and quaffing off the mixture
with a relish. As for the men, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
lounge there continually, drinking till they
are drunken,&mdash;drinking as long as they
have a halfpenny left,&mdash;and then, as it
seemed to me, waiting for a sixpenny miracle
to be wrought in their pockets so as
to enable them to be drunken again. Most
of these establishments have a significant
advertisement of "Beds," doubtless for
the accommodation of their customers in
the interval between one intoxication and
the next. I never could find it in my
heart, however, utterly to condemn these
sad revelers, and should certainly wait till
I had some better consolation to offer
before depriving them of their dram of
gin, though death itself were in the glass;
for methought their poor souls needed
such fiery stimulant to lift them a little
way out of the smothering squalor of both
their outward and interior life, giving them
glimpses and suggestions, even if bewildering
ones, of a spiritual existence that
limited their present misery. The temperance-reformers
unquestionably derive their
commission from the Divine Beneficence,
but have never been taken fully into its
counsels. All may not be lost, though
those good men fail.</p>

<p>Pawnbrokers' establishments&mdash;distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
by the mystic symbol of the three
golden balls,&mdash;were conveniently accessible;
though what personal property these
wretched people could possess, capable of
being estimated in silver or copper, so as
to afford a basis for a loan, was a problem
that still perplexes me. Old clothesmen,
likewise, dwelt hard by, and hung out ancient
garments to dangle in the wind.
There were butchers' shops, too, of a class
adapted to the neighborhood, presenting
no such generously fattened carcasses as
Englishmen love to gaze at in the market,
no stupendous halves of mighty beeves, no
dead hogs, or muttons ornamented with
carved bas-reliefs of fat on their ribs and
shoulders, in a peculiarly British style of
art,&mdash;not these, but bits and gobbets of
lean meat, selvages snipt off from steaks,
tough and stringy morsels, bare bones
smitten away from joints by the cleaver;
tripe, liver, bullocks' feet, or whatever else
was cheapest and divisible into the smallest
lots. I am afraid that even such delicacies
came to many of their tables hardly
oftener than Christmas. In the windows
of other little shops you saw half a dozen
wizened herrings; some eggs in a basket,
looking so dingily antique that your imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
smelt them; fly-speckled biscuits,
segments of a hungry cheese, pipes and
papers of tobacco. Now and then a sturdy
milk-woman passed by with a wooden yoke
over her shoulders, supporting a pail on
either side, filled with a whitish fluid, the
composition of which was water and chalk
and the milk of a sickly cow, who gave
the best she had, poor thing! but could
scarcely make it rich or wholesome, spending
her life in some close city-nook and
pasturing on strange food. I have seen,
once or twice, a donkey coming into one
of these streets with panniers full of vegetables,
and departing with a return cargo of
what looked like rubbish and street-sweepings.
No other commerce seemed to exist,
except, possibly, a girl might offer you a
pair of stockings or a worked collar, or a
man whisper something mysterious about
wonderfully cheap cigars. And yet I remember
seeing female hucksters in those
regions, with their wares on the edge of
the sidewalk and their own seats right in
the carriage-way, pretending to sell half-decayed
oranges and apples, toffy, Ormskirk
cakes, combs, and cheap jewelry, the
coarsest kind of crockery, and little plates
of oysters,&mdash;knitting patiently all day long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
and removing their undiminished stock in
trade at nightfall. All indispensable importations
from other quarters of the town
were on a remarkably diminutive scale: for
example, the wealthier inhabitants purchased
their coal by the wheelbarrow-load,
and the poorer ones by the peck-measure.
It was a curious and melancholy spectacle,
when an overladen coal-cart happened to
pass through the street and drop a handful
or two of its burden in the mud, to see half
a dozen women and children scrambling
for the treasure-trove, like a flock of hens
and chickens gobbling up some spilt corn.
In this connection I may as well mention
a commodity of boiled snails (for such they
appeared to me, though probably a marine
production) which used to be peddled from
door to door, piping hot, as an article of
cheap nutriment.</p>

<p>The population of these dismal abodes
appeared to consider the sidewalks and
middle of the street as their common hall.
In a drama of low life, the unity of place
might be arranged rigidly according to the
classic rule, and the street be the one
locality in which every scene and incident
should occur. Courtship, quarrels, plot
and counterplot, conspiracies for robbery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
and murder, family difficulties or agreements,&mdash;all
such matters, I doubt not, are
constantly discussed or transacted in this
sky-roofed saloon, so regally hung with its
sombre canopy of coal-smoke. Whatever
the disadvantages of the English climate,
the only comfortable or wholesome part of
life, for the city poor, must be spent in the
open air. The stifled and squalid rooms
where they lie down at night, whole families
and neighborhoods together, or sulkily
elbow one another in the daytime, when a
settled rain drives them within doors, are
worse horrors than it is worth while (without
a practical object in view) to admit into
one's imagination. No wonder that they
creep forth from the foul mystery of their
interiors, stumble down from their garrets,
or scramble up out of their cellars, on the
upper step of which you may see the grimy
housewife, before the shower is ended,
letting the raindrops gutter down her visage;
while her children (an impish progeny
of cavernous recesses below the common
sphere of humanity) swarm into the daylight
and attain all that they know of personal
purification in the nearest mud-puddle.
It might almost make a man
doubt the existence of his own soul, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
observe how Nature has flung these little
wretches into the street and left them
there, so evidently regarding them as
nothing worth, and how all mankind acquiesce
in the great mother's estimate of her
offspring. For, if they are to have no
immortality, what superior claim can I
assert for mine? And how difficult to believe
that anything so precious as a germ
of immortal growth can have been buried
under this dirt-heap, plunged into this
cesspool of misery and vice! As often as
I beheld the scene, it affected me with
surprise and loathsome interest, much resembling,
though in a far intenser degree,
the feeling with which, when a boy, I used
to turn over a plank or an old log that had
long lain on the damp ground, and found a
vivacious multitude of unclean and devilish-looking
insects scampering to and fro beneath
it. Without an infinite faith, there
seemed as much prospect of a blessed
futurity for those hideous bugs and many-footed
worms as for these brethren of our
humanity and co-heirs of all our heavenly
inheritance. Ah, what a mystery! Slowly,
slowly, as after groping at the bottom of a
deep, noisome, stagnant pool, my hope
struggles upward to the surface, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
the half-drowned body of a child along
with it, and heaving it aloft for its life, and
my own life, and all our lives. Unless
these slime-clogged nostrils can be made
capable of inhaling celestial air, I know
not how the purest and most intellectual
of us can reasonably expect ever to taste a
breath of it. The whole question of eternity
is staked there. If a single one of
those helpless little ones be lost, the world
is lost!</p>

<p>The women and children greatly preponderate
in such places; the men probably
wandering abroad in quest of that daily
miracle, a dinner and a drink, or perhaps
slumbering in the daylight that they may
the better follow out their cat-like rambles
through the dark. Here are women
with young figures, but old, wrinkled, yellow
faces, tanned and blear-eyed with the
smoke which they cannot spare from their
scanty fires,&mdash;it being too precious for its
warmth to be swallowed by the chimney.
Some of them sit on the doorsteps, nursing
their unwashed babies at bosoms which we
will glance aside from, for the sake of our
mothers and all womanhood, because the
fairest spectacle is here the foulest. Yet
motherhood, in these dark abodes, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
strangely identical with what we have
all known it to be in the happiest homes.
Nothing, as I remember, smote me with
more grief and pity (all the more poignant
because perplexingly entangled with an
inclination to smile) than to hear a gaunt
and ragged mother priding herself on the
pretty ways of her ragged and skinny infant,
just as a young matron might, when
she invites her lady friends to admire her
plump, white-robed darling in the nursery.
Indeed, no womanly characteristic seemed
to have altogether perished out of these
poor souls. It was the very same creature
whose tender torments make the rapture
of our young days, whom we love, cherish,
and protect, and rely upon in life and
death, and whom we delight to see beautify
her beauty with rich robes and set it off
with jewels, though now fantastically masquerading
in a garb of tatters, wholly unfit
for her to handle. I recognized her, over
and over again, in the groups round a doorstep
or in the descent of a cellar, chatting
with prodigious earnestness about intangible
trifles, laughing for a little jest, sympathizing
at almost the same instant with
one neighbor's sunshine and another's
shadow; wise, simple, sly, and patient, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
easily perturbed, and breaking into small
feminine ebullitions of spite, wrath, and
jealousy, tornadoes of a moment, such as
vary the social atmosphere of her silken-skirted
sisters, though smothered into propriety
by dint of a well-bred habit. Not
that there was an absolute deficiency of
good-breeding, even here. It often surprised
me to witness a courtesy and deference
among these ragged folks, which,
having seen it, I did not thoroughly believe
in, wondering whence it should have come.
I am persuaded, however, that there were
laws of intercourse which they never violated,&mdash;a
code of the cellar, the garret, the
common staircase, the doorstep, and the
pavement, which, perhaps, had as deep a
foundation in natural fitness as the code of
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Yet again I doubt whether I may not
have been uttering folly in the last two
sentences, when I reflect how rude and
rough these specimens of feminine character
generally were. They had a readiness
with their hands that reminded me of
Molly Seagrim and other heroines in Fielding's
novels. For example, I have seen
a woman meet a man in the street, and,
for no reason perceptible to me, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
clutch him by the hair and cuff his ears,&mdash;an
infliction which he bore with exemplary
patience, only snatching the very earliest
opportunity to take to his heels. Where a
sharp tongue will not serve the purpose,
they trust to the sharpness of their finger-nails,
or incarnate a whole vocabulary of
vituperative words in a resounding slap, or
the downright blow of a doubled fist. All
English people, I imagine, are influenced
in a far greater degree than ourselves by
this simple and honest tendency, in cases
of disagreement, to batter one another's
persons; and whoever has seen a crowd of
English ladies (for instance, at the door of
the Sistine Chapel, in Holy Week) will be
satisfied that their belligerent propensities
are kept in abeyance only by a merciless
rigor on the part of society. It requires a
vast deal of refinement to spiritualize their
large physical endowments. Such being
the case with the delicate ornaments of
the drawing-room, it is less to be wondered
at that women who live mostly in the open
air, amid the coarsest kind of companionship
and occupation, should carry on the
intercourse of life with a freedom unknown
to any class of American females, though
still, I am resolved to think, compatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
with a generous breadth of natural propriety.
It shocked me, at first, to see them
(of all ages, even elderly, as well as infants
that could just toddle across the street
alone) going about in the mud and mire, or
through the dusky snow and slosh of a
severe week in winter, with petticoats high
uplifted above bare, red feet and legs; but
I was comforted by observing that both
shoes and stockings generally reappeared
with better weather, having been thriftily
kept out of the damp for the convenience
of dry feet within doors. Their hardihood
was wonderful, and their strength greater
than could have been expected from such
spare diet as they probably lived upon. I
have seen them carrying on their heads
great burdens under which they walked as
freely as if they were fashionable bonnets;
or sometimes the burden was huge enough
almost to cover the whole person, looked
at from behind,&mdash;as in Tuscan villages you
may see the girls coming in from the country
with great bundles of green twigs upon
their backs, so that they resemble locomotive
masses of verdure and fragrance. But
these poor English women seemed to be
laden with rubbish, incongruous and indescribable,
such as bones and rags, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
sweepings of the house and of the street,
a merchandise gathered up from what poverty
itself had thrown away, a heap of
filthy stuff analogous to Christian's bundle
of sin.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though very seldom, I detected
a certain gracefulness among the
younger women that was altogether new
to my observation. It was a charm proper
to the lowest class. One girl I particularly
remember, in a garb none of the cleanest
and nowise smart, and herself exceedingly
coarse in all respects, but yet endowed
with a sort of witchery, a native charm, a
robe of simple beauty and suitable behavior
that she was born in and had never been
tempted to throw off, because she had
really nothing else to put on. Eve herself
could not have been more natural. Nothing
was affected, nothing imitated; no
proper grace was vulgarized by an effort
to assume the manners or adornments of
another sphere. This kind of beauty, arrayed
in a fitness of its own, is probably
vanishing out of the world, and will certainly
never be found in America, where all
the girls, whether daughters of the upper-tendom,
the mediocrity, the cottage, or the
kennel, aim at one standard of dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
deportment, seldom accomplishing a perfectly
triumphant hit or an utterly absurd
failure. Those words, "genteel" and "ladylike,"
are terrible ones, and do us infinite
mischief, but it is because (at least, I hope
so) we are in a transition state, and shall
emerge into a higher mode of simplicity
than has ever been known to past ages.</p>

<p>In such disastrous circumstances as I
have been attempting to describe, it was
beautiful to observe what a mysterious efficacy
still asserted itself in character. A
woman, evidently poor as the poorest of
her neighbors, would be knitting or sewing
on the doorstep, just as fifty other women
were; but round about her skirts (though
wofully patched) you would be sensible of
a certain sphere of decency, which, it
seemed to me, could not have been kept
more impregnable in the cosiest little sitting-room,
where the teakettle on the hob
was humming its good old song of domestic
peace. Maidenhood had a similar power.
The evil habit that grows upon us in this
harsh world makes me faithless to my own
better perceptions; and yet I have seen
girls in these wretched streets, on whose
virgin purity, judging merely from their
impression on my instincts as they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
by, I should have deemed it safe, at the
moment, to stake my life. The next moment,
however, as the surrounding flood of
moral uncleanness surged over their footsteps,
I would not have staked a spike of
thistle-down on the same wager. Yet the
miracle was within the scope of Providence,
which is equally wise and equally beneficent
(even to those poor girls, though I
acknowledge the fact without the remotest
comprehension of the mode of it), whether
they were pure or what we fellow-sinners
call vile. Unless your faith be deep-rooted
and of most vigorous growth, it is the
safer way not to turn aside into this region
so suggestive of miserable doubt. It was
a place "with dreadful faces thronged,"
wrinkled and grim with vice and wretchedness;
and, thinking over the line of Milton
here quoted, I come to the conclusion
that those ugly lineaments which startled
Adam and Eve, as they looked backward to
the closed gate of Paradise, were no fiends
from the pit, but the more terrible fore-shadowings
of what so many of their descendants
were to be. God help them, and
us likewise, their brethren and sisters!
Let me add, that, forlorn, ragged, careworn,
hopeless, dirty, haggard, hungry, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
were, the most pitiful thing of all was to
see the sort of patience with which they
accepted their lot, as if they had been born
into the world for that and nothing else.
Even the little children had this characteristic
in as perfect development as their
grandmothers.</p>

<p>The children, in truth, were the ill-omened
blossoms from which another harvest
of precisely such dark fruitage as I
saw ripened around me was to be produced.
Of course you would imagine these to be
lumps of crude iniquity, tiny vessels as full
as they could hold of naughtiness; nor can
I say a great deal to the contrary. Small
proof of parental discipline could I discern,
save when a mother (drunken, I sincerely
hope) snatched her own imp out of a group
of pale, half-naked, humor-eaten abortions
that were playing and squabbling together
in the mud, turned up its tatters, brought
down her heavy hand on its poor little
tenderest part, and let it go again with a
shake. If the child knew what the punishment
was for, it was wiser than I pretend
to be. It yelled and went back to its playmates
in the mud. Yet let me bear testimony
to what was beautiful, and more
touching than anything that I ever witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
before in the intercourse of happier
children. I allude to the superintendence
which some of these small people (too small,
one would think, to be sent into the street
alone, had there been any other nursery
for them) exercised over still smaller ones.
Whence they derived such a sense of duty,
unless immediately from God, I cannot
tell; but it was wonderful to observe the
expression of responsibility in their deportment,
the anxious fidelity with which they
discharged their unfit office, the tender patience
with which they linked their less
pliable impulses to the wayward footsteps
of an infant, and let it guide them whithersoever
it liked. In the hollow-cheeked,
large-eyed girl of ten, whom I saw giving
a cheerless oversight to her baby-brother,
I did not so much marvel at it. She had
merely come a little earlier than usual to
the perception of what was to be her business
in life. But I admired the sickly-looking
little boy, who did violence to his
boyish nature by making himself the servant
of his little sister,&mdash;she too small to
walk, and he too small to take her in his
arms,&mdash;and therefore working a kind of
miracle to transport her from one dirt-heap
to another. Beholding such works of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
and duty, I took heart again, and deemed
it not so impossible, after all, for these
neglected children to find a path through
the squalor and evil of their circumstances
up to the gate of heaven. Perhaps there
was this latent good in all of them, though
generally they looked brutish, and dull even
in their sports; there was little mirth
among them, nor even a fully awakened
spirit of blackguardism. Yet sometimes,
again, I saw, with surprise and a sense as
if I had been asleep and dreaming, the
bright, intelligent, merry face of a child
whose dark eyes gleamed with vivacious
expression through the dirt that incrusted
its skin, like sunshine struggling through
a very dusty window-pane.</p>

<p>In these streets the belted and blue-coated
policeman appears seldom in comparison
with the frequency of his occurrence
in more reputable thoroughfares. I
used to think that the inhabitants would
have ample time to murder one another, or
any stranger, like myself, who might violate
the filthy sanctities of the place, before
the law could bring up its lumbering
assistance. Nevertheless, there is a supervision;
nor does the watchfulness of authority
permit the populace to be tempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
any outbreak. Once, in a time of dearth,
I noticed a ballad-singer going through the
street hoarsely chanting some discordant
strain in a provincial dialect, of which I
could only make out that it addressed the
sensibilities of the auditors on the score
of starvation; but by his side stalked the
policeman, offering no interference, but
watchful to hear what this rough minstrel
said or sang, and silence him, if his effusion
threatened to prove too soul-stirring. In
my judgment, however, there is little or no
danger of that kind: they starve patiently,
sicken patiently, die patiently, not through
resignation, but a diseased flaccidity of
hope. If ever they should do mischief to
those above them, it will probably be by
the communication of some destructive
pestilence; for, so the medical men affirm,
they suffer all the ordinary diseases with
a degree of virulence elsewhere unknown,
and keep among themselves traditionary
plagues that have long ceased to afflict
more fortunate societies. Charity herself
gathers her robe about her to avoid their
contact. It would be a dire revenge, indeed,
if they were to prove their claims to
be reckoned of one blood and nature with
the noblest and wealthiest, by compelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
them to inhale death through the diffusion
of their own poverty-poisoned atmosphere.</p>

<p>A true Englishman is a kind man at
heart, but has an unconquerable dislike to
poverty and beggary. Beggars have heretofore
been so strange to an American that
he is apt to become their prey, being recognized
through his national peculiarities,
and beset by them in the streets. The
English smile at him, and say that there
are ample public arrangements for every
pauper's possible need, that street charity
promotes idleness and vice, and that yonder
personification of misery on the pavement
will lay up a good day's profit, besides
supping more luxuriously than the
dupe who gives him a shilling. By and by
the stranger adopts their theory and begins
to practice upon it, much to his own
temporary freedom from annoyance, but
not entirely without moral detriment or
sometimes a too late contrition. Years
afterwards, it may be, his memory is still
haunted by some vindictive wretch whose
cheeks were pale and hunger-pinched,
whose rags fluttered in the east-wind,
whose right arm was paralyzed and his left
leg shriveled into a mere nerveless stick,
but whom he passed by remorselessly because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
an Englishman chose to say that the
fellow's misery looked too perfect, was too
artistically got up, to be genuine. Even
allowing this to be true (as, a hundred
chances to one, it was), it would still have
been a clear case of economy to buy him
off with a little loose silver, so that his
lamentable figure should not limp at the
heels of your conscience all over the world.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
To own the truth, I provided myself with
several such imaginary persecutors in England,
and recruited their number with at
least one sickly-looking wretch whose acquaintance
I first made at Assisi, in Italy,
and, taking a dislike to something sinister
in his aspect, permitted him to beg early
and late, and all day long, without getting
a single baiocco. At my latest glimpse of
him, the villain avenged himself, not by a
volley of horrible curses as any other Italian
beggar would, but by taking an expression
so grief-stricken, want-wrung, hopeless,
and withal resigned, that I could paint
his lifelike portrait at this moment. Were
I to go over the same ground again, I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>listen to no man's theories, but buy the little
luxury of beneficence at a cheap rate,
instead of doing myself a moral mischief
by exuding a stony incrustation over whatever
natural sensibility I might possess.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The natural man cries out against the philosophy
that rejects beggars. It is a thousand to one that they
are impostors, but yet we do ourselves a wrong by hardening
our hearts against them.&mdash;II. 152.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, there were some
mendicants whose utmost efforts I even
now felicitate myself on having withstood.
Such was a phenomenon abridged of his
lower half, who beset me for two or three
years together, and, in spite of his deficiency
of locomotive members, had some
supernatural method of transporting himself
(simultaneously, I believe) to all quarters
of the city. He wore a sailor's jacket
(possibly, because skirts would have been
a superfluity to his figure), and had a remarkably
broad-shouldered and muscular
frame, surmounted by a large, fresh-colored
face, which was full of power and intelligence.
His dress and linen were the perfection
of neatness. Once a day, at least,
wherever I went, I suddenly became aware
of this trunk of a man on the path before
me, resting on his base, and looking as if
he had just sprouted out of the pavement,
and would sink into it again and reappear
at some other spot the instant you left him
behind. The expression of his eye was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
perfectly respectful, but terribly fixed,
holding your own as by fascination, never
once winking, never wavering from its
point-blank gaze right into your face, till
you were completely beyond the range of
his battery of one immense rifled cannon.
This was his mode of soliciting alms; and
he reminded me of the old beggar who appealed
so touchingly to the charitable sympathies
of Gil Blas, taking aim at him
from the roadside with a long-barreled
musket. The intentness and directness of
his silent appeal, his close and unrelenting
attack upon your individuality, respectful
as it seemed, was the very flower of insolence;
or, if you give it a possibly truer
interpretation, it was the tyrannical effort
of a man endowed with great natural force
of character to constrain your reluctant
will to his purpose. Apparently, he had
staked his salvation upon the ultimate success
of a daily struggle between himself
and me, the triumph of which would compel
me to become a tributary to the hat
that lay on the pavement beside him. Man
or fiend, however, there was a stubbornness
in his intended victim which this massive
fragment of a mighty personality had not
altogether reckoned upon, and by its aid I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
was enabled to pass him at my customary
pace hundreds of times over, quietly meeting
his terribly respectful eye, and allowing
him the fair chance which I felt to be his
due, to subjugate me, if he really had the
strength for it. He never succeeded, but,
on the other hand, never gave up the contest;
and should I ever walk those streets
again, I am certain that the truncated tyrant
will sprout up through the pavement
and look me fixedly in the eye, and perhaps
get the victory.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Among the beggars of Liverpool, the hardest to encounter
is a man without any legs, and if I mistake not,
likewise deficient in arms. You see him before you all
at once, as if he had sprouted half-way out of the earth,
and would sink down and reappear in some other place
the moment he has done with you. His countenance is
large, fresh, and very intelligent; but his great power
lies in his fixed gaze, which is inconceivably difficult to
bear. He never once removes his eye from you till you
are quite past his range; and you feel it all the same,
although you do not meet his glance. He is perfectly
respectful; but the intentness and directness of his silent
appeal is far worse than any impudence. In fact, it is
the very flower of impudence. I would rather go a mile
about than pass before his battery. I feel wronged by
him, and yet unutterably ashamed. There must be great
force in the man to produce such an effect. There is
nothing of the customary squalidness of beggary about
him, but remarkable trimness and cleanliness.&mdash;I. 475.</p></div>

<p>I should think all the more highly of
myself, if I had shown equal heroism in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>resisting another class of beggarly depredators,
who assailed me on my weaker side
and won an easy spoil. Such was the
sanctimonious clergyman, with his white
cravat, who visited me with a subscription-paper,
which he himself had drawn up, in a
case of heart-rending distress;&mdash;the respectable
and ruined tradesman, going from
door to door, shy and silent in his own person,
but accompanied by a sympathizing
friend, who bore testimony to his integrity,
and stated the unavoidable misfortunes that
had crushed him down;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;or the delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>and prettily dressed lady, who had been
bred in affluence, but was suddenly thrown
upon the perilous charities of the world
by the death of an indulgent, but secretly
insolvent father, or the commercial catastrophe
and simultaneous suicide of the best
of husbands;&mdash;or the gifted, but unsuccessful
author, appealing to my fraternal
sympathies, generously rejoicing in some
small prosperities which he was kind
enough to term my own triumphs in the
field of letters, and claiming to have largely
contributed to them by his unbought notices
in the public journals. England is
full of such people, and a hundred other
varieties of peripatetic tricksters, higher
than these, and lower, who act their parts
tolerably well, but seldom with an absolutely
illusive effect. I knew at once, raw
Yankee as I was, that they were humbugs,
almost without an exception,&mdash;rats that
nibble at the honest bread and cheese of
the community, and grow fat by their petty
pilferings,&mdash;yet often gave them what
they asked, and privately owned myself a
simpleton. There is a decorum which re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>strains
you (unless you happen to be a
police-constable) from breaking through a
crust of plausible respectability, even when
you are certain that there is a knave beneath
it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> It appears to be customary for people of decent
station, but in distressed circumstances, to go round
among their neighbors and the public, accompanied by a
friend, who explains the case. I have been accosted in
the street in regard to one of these matters; and to-day
there came to my office a grocer, who had become security
for a friend, and who was threatened with an execution,&mdash;with
another grocer for supporter and advocate.
The beneficiary takes very little active part in the affair,
merely looking careworn, distressed, and pitiable, and
throwing in a word of corroboration, or a sigh, or an acknowledgment,
as the case may demand.... The whole
matter is very foreign to American habits. No respectable
American would think of retrieving his affairs by
such means, but would prefer ruin ten times over; no
friend would take up his cause; no public would think
it worth while to prevent the small catastrophe. And
yet the custom is not without its good side, as indicating
a closer feeling of brotherhood, a more efficient sense of
neighborhood, than exists among ourselves, although,
perhaps, we are more careless of a fellow-creature's ruin,
because ruin with us is by no means the fatal and irretrievable
event that it is in England.&mdash;I. 543.</p></div>

<p>After making myself as familiar as I
decently could with the poor streets, I became
curious to see what kind of a home
was provided for the inhabitants at the
public expense, fearing that it must needs
be a most comfortless one, or else their
choice (if choice it were) of so miserable a
life outside was truly difficult to account
for. Accordingly, I visited a great almshouse,
and was glad to observe how unexceptionably
all the parts of the establishment
were carried on, and what an orderly
life, full-fed, sufficiently reposeful, and undisturbed
by the arbitrary exercise of authority,
seemed to be led there. Possibly,
indeed, it was that very orderliness, and
the cruel necessity of being neat and clean,
and even the comfort resulting from these
and other Christian-like restraints and regulations,
that constituted the principal
grievance on the part of the poor, shiftless
inmates, accustomed to a lifelong luxury
of dirt and harum-scarumness. The wild
life of the streets has perhaps as unforgetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
a charm, to those who have once
thoroughly imbibed it, as the life of the
forest or the prairie. But I conceive rather
that there must be insuperable difficulties,
for the majority of the poor, in the way of
getting admittance to the almshouse, than
that a merely &aelig;sthetic preference for the
street would incline the pauper class to fare
scantily and precariously, and expose their
raggedness to the rain and snow, when
such a hospitable door stood wide open for
their entrance. It might be that the roughest
and darkest side of the matter was not
shown me, there being persons of eminent
station and of both sexes in the party
which I accompanied; and, of course, a
properly trained public functionary would
have deemed it a monstrous rudeness, as
well as a great shame, to exhibit anything
to people of rank that might too painfully
shock their sensibilities.</p>

<p>The women's ward was the portion of
the establishment which we especially examined.
It could not be questioned that
they were treated with kindness as well as
care. No doubt, as has been already suggested,
some of them felt the irksomeness
of submission to general rules of orderly
behavior, after being accustomed to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
perfect freedom from the minor proprieties,
at least, which is one of the compensations
of absolutely hopeless poverty, or of any
circumstances that set us fairly below the
decencies of life. I asked the governor of
the house whether he met with any difficulty
in keeping peace and order among
his inmates; and he informed me that his
troubles among the women were incomparably
greater than with the men. They
were freakish, and apt to be quarrelsome,
inclined to plague and pester one another
in ways that it was impossible to lay hold
of, and to thwart his own authority by the
like intangible methods. He said this with
the utmost good-nature, and quite won my
regard by so placidly resigning himself to
the inevitable necessity of letting the women
throw dust into his eyes. They certainly
looked peaceable and sisterly enough
as I saw them, though still it might be
faintly perceptible that some of them were
consciously playing their parts before the
governor and his distinguished visitors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus254.jpg" width="600" height="343" alt="An English Almshouse." title="">
</div>

<p class="caption">An English Almshouse.</p>

<p>This governor seemed to me a man thoroughly
fit for his position. An American,
in an office of similar responsibility, would
doubtless be a much superior person, better
educated, possessing a far wider range of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>thought, more naturally acute, with a
quicker tact of external observation and
a readier faculty of dealing with difficult
cases. The women would not succeed in
throwing half so much dust into his eyes.
Moreover, his black coat, and thin, sallow
visage, would make him look like a scholar,
and his manners would indefinitely approximate
to those of a gentleman. But I
cannot help questioning whether, on the
whole, these higher endowments would
produce decidedly better results. The
Englishman was thoroughly plebeian both
in aspect and behavior, a bluff, ruddy-faced,
hearty, kindly, yeoman-like personage, with
no refinement whatever, nor any superfluous
sensibility, but gifted with a native
wholesomeness of character which must
have been a very beneficial element in the
atmosphere of the almshouse. He spoke
to his pauper family in loud, good-humored,
cheerful tones, and treated them with a
healthy freedom that probably caused the
forlorn wretches to feel as if they were
free and healthy likewise. If he had understood
them a little better, he would not
have treated them half so wisely. We are
apt to make sickly people more morbid,
and unfortunate people more miserable, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
endeavoring to adapt our deportment to
their especial and individual needs. They
eagerly accept our well-meant efforts; but
it is like returning their own sick breath
back upon themselves, to be breathed over
and over again, intensifying the inward
mischief at every reception. The sympathy
that would really do them good is of
a kind that recognizes their sound and
healthy parts, and ignores the part affected
by disease, which will thrive under the eye
of a too close observer like a poisonous
weed in the sunshine. My good friend the
governor had no tendencies in the latter
direction, and abundance of them in the
former, and was consequently as wholesome
and invigorating as the west-wind with a
little spice of the north in it, brightening
the dreary visages that encountered us as
if he had carried a sunbeam in his hand.
He expressed himself by his whole being
and personality, and by works more than
words, and had the not unusual English
merit of knowing what to do much better
than how to talk about it.</p>

<p>The women, I imagine, must have felt
one imperfection in their state, however
comfortable otherwise. They were forbidden,
or at all events lacked the means, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
follow out their natural instinct of adorning
themselves; all were well dressed in
one homely uniform of blue-checked gowns,
with such caps upon their heads as English
servants wear. Generally, too, they had
one dowdy English aspect, and a vulgar
type of features so nearly alike that they
seemed literally to constitute a sisterhood.
We have few of these absolutely unilluminated
faces among our native American
population, individuals of whom must be
singularly unfortunate, if, mixing as we
do, no drop of gentle blood has contributed
to refine the turbid element, no gleam of
hereditary intelligence has lighted up the
stolid eyes, which their forefathers brought
from the Old Country. Even in this English
almshouse, however, there was at least
one person who claimed to be intimately
connected with rank and wealth. The
governor, after suggesting that this person
would probably be gratified by our
visit, ushered us into a small parlor, which
was furnished a little more like a room
in a private dwelling than others that we
entered, and had a row of religious books
and fashionable novels on the mantelpiece.
An old lady sat at a bright coal-fire, reading
a romance, and rose to receive us with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
certain pomp of manner and elaborate display
of ceremonious courtesy, which, in
spite of myself, made me inwardly question
the genuineness of her aristocratic pretensions.
But, at any rate, she looked like
a respectable old soul, and was evidently
gladdened to the very core of her frost-bitten
heart by the awful punctiliousness
with which we responded to her gracious
and hospitable, though unfamiliar welcome.
After a little polite conversation, we retired;
and the governor, with a lowered
voice and an air of deference, told us that
she had been a lady of quality, and had
ridden in her own equipage, not many years
before, and now lived in continual expectation
that some of her rich relatives would
drive up in their carriages to take her
away. Meanwhile, he added, she was
treated with great respect by her fellow-paupers.
I could not help thinking, from a
few criticisable peculiarities in her talk and
manner, that there might have been a mistake
on the governor's part, and perhaps
a venial exaggeration on the old lady's,
concerning her former position in society;
but what struck me was the forcible instance
of that most prevalent of English
vanities, the pretension to aristocratic connection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
on one side, and the submission
and reverence with which it was accepted
by the governor and his household, on the
other. Among ourselves, I think, when
wealth and eminent position have taken
their departure, they seldom leave a pallid
ghost behind them,&mdash;or, if it sometimes
stalks abroad, few recognize it.</p>

<p>We went into several other rooms, at the
doors of which, pausing on the outside, we
could hear the volubility, and sometimes
the wrangling, of the female inhabitants
within, but invariably found silence and
peace when we stepped over the threshold.
The women were grouped together in their
sitting-rooms, sometimes three or four,
sometimes a larger number, classified by
their spontaneous affinities, I suppose, and
all busied, so far as I can remember, with
the one occupation of knitting coarse yarn
stockings. Hardly any of them, I am sorry
to say, had a brisk or cheerful air, though
it often stirred them up to a momentary
vivacity to be accosted by the governor,
and they seemed to like being noticed,
however slightly, by the visitors. The
happiest person whom I saw there (and
running hastily through my experiences, I
hardly recollect to have seen a happier one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
in my life, if you take a careless flow of
spirits as happiness) was an old woman
that lay in bed among ten or twelve heavy-looking
females, who plied their knitting-work
round about her. She laughed, when
we entered, and immediately began to talk
to us, in a thin, little, spirited quaver, claiming
to be more than a century old; and
the governor (in whatever way he happened
to be cognizant of the fact) confirmed her
age to be a hundred and four. Her jauntiness
and cackling merriment were really
wonderful. It was as if she had got
through with all her actual business in life
two or three generations ago, and now,
freed from every responsibility for herself
or others, had only to keep up a mirthful
state of mind till the short time, or long
time (and, happy as she was, she appeared
not to care whether it were long or short),
before Death, who had misplaced her name
in his list, might remember to take her
away. She had gone quite round the circle
of human existence, and come back to the
play-ground again. And so she had grown
to be a kind of miraculous old pet, the
plaything of people seventy or eighty years
younger than herself, who talked and
laughed with her as if she were a child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
finding great delight in her wayward and
strangely playful responses, into some of
which she cunningly conveyed a gibe that
caused their ears to tingle a little. She
had done getting out of bed in this world,
and lay there to be waited upon like a
queen or a baby.</p>

<p>In the same room sat a pauper who had
once been an actress of considerable repute,
but was compelled to give up her
profession by a softening of the brain.
The disease seemed to have stolen the continuity
out of her life, and disturbed all
healthy relationship between the thoughts
within her and the world without. On our
first entrance, she looked cheerfully at us,
and showed herself ready to engage in
conversation; but suddenly, while we were
talking with the century-old crone, the poor
actress began to weep, contorting her face
with extravagant stage-grimaces, and wringing
her hands for some inscrutable sorrow.
It might have been a reminiscence of actual
calamity in her past life, or, quite as
probably, it was but a dramatic woe, beneath
which she had staggered and shrieked
and wrung her hands with hundreds of
repetitions in the sight of crowded theatres,
and been as often comforted by thunders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
of applause. But my idea of the mystery
was, that she had a sense of wrong in
seeing the aged woman (whose empty vivacity
was like the rattling of dry peas in a
bladder) chosen as the central object of
interest to the visitors, while she herself,
who had agitated thousands of hearts with
a breath, sat starving for the admiration
that was her natural food. I appeal to the
whole society of artists of the Beautiful
and the Imaginative,&mdash;poets, romancers,
painters, sculptors, actors,&mdash;whether or no
this is a grief that may be felt even amid
the torpor of a dissolving brain!</p>

<p>We looked into a good many sleeping-chambers,
where were rows of beds, mostly
calculated for two occupants, and provided
with sheets and pillow-cases that resembled
sackcloth. It appeared to me that
the sense of beauty was insufficiently regarded
in all the arrangements of the almshouse;
a little cheap luxury for the eye, at
least, might do the poor folks a substantial
good. But, at all events, there was the
beauty of perfect neatness and orderliness,
which, being heretofore known to few of
them, was perhaps as much as they could
well digest in the remnant of their lives.
We were invited into the laundry, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
great washing and drying were in process,
the whole atmosphere being hot and vaporous
with the steam of wet garments and
bedclothes. This atmosphere was the pauper-life
of the past week or fortnight resolved
into a gaseous state, and breathing
it, however fastidiously, we were forced to
inhale the strange element into our inmost
being. Had the Queen been there, I know
not how she could have escaped the necessity.
What an intimate brotherhood is
this in which we dwell, do what we may to
put an artificial remoteness between the
high creature and the low one! A poor
man's breath, borne on the vehicle of tobacco-smoke,
floats into a palace-window
and reaches the nostrils of a monarch. It
is but an example, obvious to the sense, of
the innumerable and secret channels by
which, at every moment of our lives, the
flow and reflux of a common humanity pervade
us all. How superficial are the niceties
of such as pretend to keep aloof! Let
the whole world be cleansed, or not a man
or woman of us all can be clean.</p>

<p>By and by we came to the ward where
the children were kept, on entering which,
we saw, in the first place, several unlovely
and unwholesome little people lazily playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
together in a court-yard. And here a
singular incommodity befell one member
of our party. Among the children was a
wretched, pale, half-torpid little thing
(about six years old, perhaps, but I know
not whether a girl or a boy), with a humor
in its eyes and face, which the governor
said was the scurvy, and which appeared
to bedim its powers of vision, so that it
toddled about gropingly, as if in quest of it
did not precisely know what. This child&mdash;this
sickly, wretched, humor-eaten infant,
the offspring of unspeakable sin and sorrow,
whom it must have required several generations
of guilty progenitors to render so
pitiable an object as we beheld it&mdash;immediately
took an unaccountable fancy to
the gentleman just hinted at. It prowled
about him like a pet kitten, rubbing against
his legs, following everywhere at his heels,
pulling at his coat-tails, and, at last, exerting
all the speed that its poor limbs were
capable of, got directly before him and
held forth its arms, mutely insisting on
being taken up. It said not a word, being
perhaps underwitted and incapable of prattle.
But it smiled up in his face,&mdash;a sort
of woful gleam was that smile, through the
sickly blotches that covered its features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>&mdash;and
found means to express such a perfect
confidence that it was going to be fondled
and made much of, that there was no possibility
in a human heart of balking its expectation.
It was as if God had promised
the poor child this favor on behalf of that
individual, and he was bound to fulfill the
contract, or else no longer call himself a
man among men. Nevertheless, it could
be no easy thing for him to do, he being a
person burdened with more than an Englishman's
customary reserve, shy of actual
contact with human beings, afflicted with
a peculiar distaste for whatever was ugly,
and, furthermore, accustomed to that habit
of observation from an insulated standpoint
which is said (but, I hope, erroneously)
to have the tendency of putting ice
into the blood.</p>

<p>So I watched the struggle in his mind
with a good deal of interest, and am seriously
of opinion that he did an heroic act,
and effected more than he dreamed of towards
his final salvation, when he took up
the loathsome child and caressed it as tenderly
as if he had been its father. To be
sure, we all smiled at him, at the time, but
doubtless would have acted pretty much
the same in a similar stress of circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
The child, at any rate, appeared
to be satisfied with his behavior; for when
he had held it a considerable time, and set
it down, it still favored him with its company,
keeping fast hold of his forefinger
till we reached the confines of the place.
And on our return through the court-yard,
after visiting another part of the establishment,
here again was this same little
Wretchedness waiting for its victim, with
a smile of joyful, and yet dull recognition
about its scabby mouth and in its rheumy
eyes. No doubt, the child's mission in
reference to our friend was to remind him
that he was responsible, in his degree, for
all the sufferings and misdemeanors of
the world in which he lived, and was not
entitled to look upon a particle of its dark
calamity as if it were none of his concern:
the offspring of a brother's iniquity being
his own blood-relation, and the guilt, likewise,
a burden on him, unless he expiated
it by better deeds.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> <i>February 28, 1856.</i> "After this, we went to the ward
[West Derby Workhouse] where the children were kept,
and, on entering this, we saw, in the first place, two or
three unlovely and unwholesome little imps, who were
lazily playing together. One of them (a child about six
years old, but I know not whether girl or boy) immediately
took the strangest fancy for me. It was a wretched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
pale, half-torpid little thing, with a humor in its eyes
which the governor said was the scurvy. I never saw,
till a few moments afterwards, a child that I should feel
less inclined to fondle. But this little, sickly, humor-eaten
fright prowled around me, taking hold of my skirts,
following at my heels, and at last held up its hands,
smiled in my face, and, standing directly before me, insisted
on my taking it up! Not that it said a word, for
I rather think it was underwitted, and could not talk;
but its face expressed such perfect confidence that it
was going to be taken up and made much of, that it
was impossible not to do it. It was as if God had
promised the child this favor on my behalf, and that I
must needs fulfill the contract. I held my undesirable
burden a little while; and, after setting the child down,
it still followed me, holding two of my fingers and playing
with them, just as if it were a child of my own. It
was a foundling, and out of all human kind it chose me
to be its father! We went up stairs into another ward;
and, on coming down again, there was this same child
waiting for me, with a sickly smile round its defaced
mouth, and in its dim red eyes.... I never should
have forgiven myself if I had repelled its advances."&mdash;II.
184.</p></div>

<p>All the children in this ward seemed to
be invalids, and, going upstairs, we found
more of them in the same or a worse condition
than the little creature just described,
with their mothers (or more probably
other women, for the infants were
mostly foundlings) in attendance as nurses.
The matron of the ward, a middle-aged
woman, remarkably kind and motherly in
aspect, was walking to and fro across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>chamber&mdash;on that weary journey in which
careful mothers and nurses travel so continually
and so far, and gain never a step
of progress&mdash;with an unquiet baby in her
arms. She assured us that she enjoyed
her occupation, being exceedingly fond of
children; and, in fact, the absence of timidity
in all the little people was a sufficient
proof that they could have had no
experience of harsh treatment, though, on
the other hand, none of them appeared to
be attracted to one individual more than
another. In this point they differed widely
from the poor child below stairs. They
seemed to recognize a universal motherhood
in womankind, and cared not which
individual might be the mother of the moment.
I found their tameness as shocking
as did Alexander Selkirk that of the
brute subjects of his else solitary kingdom.
It was a sort of tame familiarity, a perfect
indifference to the approach of strangers,
such as I never noticed in other children.
I accounted for it partly by their nerveless,
unstrung state of body, incapable of the
quick thrills of delight and fear which play
upon the lively harp-strings of a healthy
child's nature, and partly by their woful
lack of acquaintance with a private home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
and their being therefore destitute of the
sweet home-bred shyness, which is like the
sanctity of heaven about a mother-petted
child. Their condition was like that of
chickens hatched in an oven, and growing
up without the especial guardianship of a
matron hen: both the chicken and the
child, methinks, must needs want something
that is essential to their respective
characters.</p>

<p>In this chamber (which was spacious,
containing a large number of beds) there
was a clear fire burning on the hearth, as
in all the other occupied rooms; and directly
in front of the blaze sat a woman
holding a baby, which, beyond all reach of
comparison, was the most horrible object
that ever afflicted my sight. Days afterwards&mdash;nay,
even now, when I bring it up
vividly before my mind's eye&mdash;it seemed
to lie upon the floor of my heart, polluting
my moral being with the sense of
something grievously amiss in the entire
conditions of humanity. The holiest man
could not be otherwise than full of wickedness,
the chastest virgin seemed impure,
in a world where such a babe was possible.
The governor whispered me, apart,
that, like nearly all the rest of them, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
the child of unhealthy parents. Ah, yes!
There was the mischief. This spectral infant,
a hideous mockery of the visible link
which Love creates between man and woman,
was born of disease and sin. Diseased
Sin was its father, and Sinful Disease
its mother, and their offspring lay in the
woman's arms like a nursing Pestilence,
which, could it live and grow up, would
make the world a more accursed abode
than ever heretofore. Thank Heaven, it
could not live! This baby, if we must
give it that sweet name, seemed to be
three or four months old, but, being such
an unthrifty changeling, might have been
considerably older. It was all covered
with blotches, and preternaturally dark and
discolored; it was withered away, quite
shrunken and fleshless; it breathed only
amid pantings and gaspings, and moaned
painfully at every gasp. The only comfort
in reference to it was the evident impossibility
of its surviving to draw many more
of those miserable, moaning breaths; and
it would have been infinitely less heart-depressing
to see it die, right before my
eyes, than to depart and carry it alive in
my remembrance, still suffering the incalculable
torture of its little life. I can by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
no means express how horrible this infant
was, neither ought I to attempt it. And
yet I must add one final touch. Young as
the poor little creature was, its pain and
misery had endowed it with a premature
intelligence, insomuch that its eyes seemed
to stare at the by-standers out of their
sunken sockets knowingly and appealingly,
as if summoning us one and all to witness
the deadly wrong of its existence.
At least, I so interpreted its look, when it
positively met and responded to my own
awe-stricken gaze, and therefore I lay the
case, as far as I am able, before mankind,
on whom God has imposed the necessity
to suffer in soul and body till this dark and
dreadful wrong be righted.</p>

<p>Thence we went to the school-rooms,
which were underneath the chapel. The
pupils, like the children whom we had just
seen, were, in large proportion, foundlings.
Almost without exception, they looked
sickly, with marks of eruptive trouble in
their doltish faces, and a general tendency
to diseases of the eye. Moreover, the
poor little wretches appeared to be uneasy
within their skins, and screwed themselves
about on the benches in a disagreeably
suggestive way, as if they had inherited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
the evil habits of their parents as an innermost
garment of the same texture and
material as the shirt of Nessus, and must
wear it with unspeakable discomfort as long
as they lived. I saw only a single child
that looked healthy; and on my pointing
him out, the governor informed me that
this little boy, the sole exception to the
miserable aspect of his school-fellows, was
not a foundling, nor properly a workhouse
child, being born of respectable parentage,
and his father one of the officers of
the institution. As for the remainder,&mdash;the
hundred pale abortions to be counted
against one rosy-cheeked boy,&mdash;what shall
we say or do? Depressed by the sight of
so much misery, and uninventive of remedies
for the evils that force themselves on
my perception, I can do little more than
recur to the idea already hinted at in the
early part of this article, regarding the
speedy necessity of a new deluge. So far
as these children are concerned, at any
rate, it would be a blessing to the human
race, which they will contribute to enervate
and corrupt,&mdash;a greater blessing to
themselves, who inherit no patrimony but
disease and vice, and in whose souls, if
there be a spark of God's life, this seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
the only possible mode of keeping it aglow,&mdash;if
every one of them could be drowned
to-night, by their best friends, instead of
being put tenderly to bed. This heroic
method of treating human maladies, moral
and material, is certainly beyond the scope
of man's discretionary rights, and probably
will not be adopted by Divine Providence
until the opportunity of milder reformation
shall have been offered us again and again,
through a series of future ages.</p>

<p>It may be fair to acknowledge that the
humane and excellent governor, as well as
other persons better acquainted with the
subject than myself, took a less gloomy
view of it, though still so dark a one as to
involve scanty consolation. They remarked
that individuals of the male sex, picked up
in the streets and nurtured in the workhouse,
sometimes succeed tolerably well in
life, because they are taught trades before
being turned into the world, and, by dint
of immaculate behavior and good luck, are
not unlikely to get employment and earn a
livelihood. The case is different with the
girls. They can only go to service, and
are invariably rejected by families of respectability
on account of their origin, and
for the better reason of their unfitness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
fill satisfactorily even the meanest situations
in a well-ordered English household.
Their resource is to take service with
people only a step or two above the poorest
class, with whom they fare scantily, endure
harsh treatment, lead shifting and precarious
lives, and finally drop into the slough
of evil, through which, in their best estate,
they do but pick their slimy way on stepping-stones.</p>

<p>From the schools we went to the bake-house,
and the brew-house (for such cruelty
is not harbored in the heart of a true Englishman
as to deny a pauper his daily
allowance of beer), and through the kitchens,
where we beheld an immense pot over
the fire, surging and walloping with some
kind of a savory stew that filled it up to its
brim. We also visited a tailor's shop, and
a shoemaker's shop, in both of which a
number of men, and pale, diminutive apprentices,
were at work, diligently enough,
though seemingly with small heart in the
business. Finally, the governor ushered
us into a shed, inside of which was piled
up an immense quantity of new coffins.
They were of the plainest description,
made of pine boards, probably of American
growth, not very nicely smoothed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
the plane, neither painted nor stained with
black, but provided with a loop of rope at
either end for the convenience of lifting
the rude box and its inmate into the cart
that shall carry them to the burial-ground.
There, in holes ten feet deep, the paupers
are buried one above another, mingling
their relics indistinguishably. In another
world may they resume their individuality,
and find it a happier one than here!</p>

<p>As we departed, a character came under
our notice which I have met with in all
almshouses, whether of the city or village,
or in England or America. It was the familiar
simpleton, who shuffled across the
court-yard, clattering his wooden-soled
shoes, to greet us with a howl or a laugh,
I hardly know which, holding out his hand
for a penny, and chuckling grossly when it
was given him. All underwitted persons,
so far as my experience goes, have this
craving for copper coin, and appear to estimate
its value by a miraculous instinct,
which is one of the earliest gleams of human
intelligence while the nobler faculties
are yet in abeyance. There may come a
time, even in this world, when we shall all
understand that our tendency to the individual
appropriation of gold and broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
acres, fine houses, and such good and beautiful
things as are equally enjoyable by a
multitude, is but a trait of imperfectly developed
intelligence, like the simpleton's
cupidity of a penny. When that day
dawns,&mdash;and probably not till then,&mdash;I
imagine that there will be no more poor
streets nor need of almshouses.</p>

<p>I was once present at the wedding of
some poor English people, and was deeply
impressed by the spectacle, though by no
means with such proud and delightful emotions
as seem to have affected all England
on the recent occasion of the marriage of
its Prince. It was in the Cathedral at
Manchester, a particularly black and grim
old structure, into which I had stepped to
examine some ancient and curious wood-carvings
within the choir. The woman in
attendance greeted me with a smile (which
always glimmers forth on the feminine visage,
I know not why, when a wedding is
in question), and asked me to take a seat
in the nave till some poor parties were
married, it being the Easter holidays, and
a good time for them to marry, because no
fees would be demanded by the clergyman.
I sat down accordingly, and soon the parson
and his clerk appeared at the altar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
a considerable crowd of people made their
entrance at a side-door, and ranged themselves
in a long, huddled line across the
chancel. They were my acquaintances of
the poor streets, or persons in a precisely
similar condition of life, and were now
come to their marriage-ceremony in just
such garbs as I had always seen them
wear: the men in their loafers' coats, out
at elbows, or their laborers' jackets, defaced
with grimy toil; the women drawing
their shabby shawls tighter about their
shoulders, to hide the raggedness beneath;
all of them unbrushed, unshaven, unwashed,
uncombed, and wrinkled with penury and
care; nothing virgin-like in the brides, nor
hopeful or energetic in the bridegrooms;&mdash;they
were, in short, the mere rags and
tatters of the human race, whom some
east-wind of evil omen, howling along the
streets, had chanced to sweep together into
an unfragrant heap. Each and all of them,
conscious of his or her individual misery,
had blundered into the strange miscalculation
of supposing that they could lessen
the sum of it by multiplying it into the
misery of another person. All the couples
(and it was difficult, in such a confused
crowd, to compute exactly their number)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
stood up at once, and had execution done
upon them in the lump, the clergyman addressing
only small parts of the service to
each individual pair, but so managing the
larger portion as to include the whole company
without the trouble of repetition. By
this compendious contrivance, one would
apprehend, he came dangerously near making
every man and woman the husband or
wife of every other; nor, perhaps, would
he have perpetrated much additional mischief
by the mistake; but, after receiving
a benediction in common, they assorted
themselves in their own fashion, as they
only knew how, and departed to the garrets,
or the cellars, or the unsheltered
street-corners, where their honeymoon and
subsequent lives were to be spent. The
parson smiled decorously, the clerk and
the sexton grinned broadly, the female
attendant tittered almost aloud, and even
the married parties seemed to see something
exceedingly funny in the affair; but
for my part, though generally apt enough
to be tickled by a joke, I laid it away in
my memory as one of the saddest sights I
ever looked upon.</p>

<p>Not very long afterwards, I happened to
be passing the same venerable cathedral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
and heard a clang of joyful bells, and beheld
a bridal party coming down the steps
towards a carriage and four horses, with a
portly coachman and two postilions, that
waited at the gate. One parson and one
service had amalgamated the wretchedness
of a score of paupers; a Bishop and
three or four clergymen had combined
their spiritual might to forge the golden
links of this other marriage-bond. The
bridegroom's mien had a sort of careless
and kindly English pride; the bride floated
along in her white drapery, a creature so
nice and delicate that it was a luxury to
see her, and a pity that her silk slippers
should touch anything so grimy as the
old stones of the churchyard avenue. The
crowd of ragged people, who always cluster
to witness what they may of an aristocratic
wedding, broke into audible admiration of
the bride's beauty and the bridegroom's
manliness, and uttered prayers and ejaculations
(possibly paid for in alms) for the
happiness of both. If the most favorable
of earthly conditions could make them
happy, they had every prospect of it. They
were going to live on their abundance in
one of those stately and delightful English
homes, such as no other people ever created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
or inherited, a hall set far and safe
within its own private grounds, and surrounded
with venerable trees, shaven lawns,
rich shrubbery, and trimmest pathways, the
whole so artfully contrived and tended that
summer rendered it a paradise, and even
winter would hardly disrobe it of its beauty;
and all this fair property seemed more exclusively
and inalienably their own, because
of its descent through many forefathers,
each of whom had added an improvement
or a charm, and thus transmitted it with a
stronger stamp of rightful possession to his
heir. And is it possible, after all, that
there may be a flaw in the title-deeds? Is,
or is not, the system wrong that gives one
married pair so immense a superfluity of
luxurious home, and shuts out a million
others from any home whatever? One
day or another, safe as they deem themselves,
and safe as the hereditary temper
of the people really tends to make them,
the gentlemen of England will be compelled
to face this question.</p>

<p class="h3">CIVIC BANQUETS</p>

<p>It has often perplexed me to imagine
how an Englishman will be able to reconcile
himself to any future state of existence
from which the earthly institution of dinner
shall be excluded. Even if he fail to take
his appetite along with him (which it seems
to me hardly possible to believe, since this
endowment is so essential to his composition),
the immortal day must still admit
an interim of two or three hours during
which he will be conscious of a slight distaste,
at all events, if not an absolute repugnance,
to merely spiritual nutriment.
The idea of dinner has so imbedded itself
among his highest and deepest characteristics,
so illuminated itself with intellect
and softened itself with the kindest emotions
of his heart, so linked itself with
Church and State, and grown so majestic
with long hereditary customs and ceremonies,
that, by taking it utterly away,
Death, instead of putting the final touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
to his perfection, would leave him infinitely
less complete than we have already known
him. He could not be roundly happy.
Paradise, among all its enjoyments, would
lack one daily felicity which his sombre
little island possessed. Perhaps it is not
irreverent to conjecture that a provision
may have been made, in this particular, for
the Englishman's exceptional necessities.
It strikes me that Milton was of the opinion
here suggested, and may have intended
to throw out a delightful and consolatory
hope for his countrymen, when he represents
the genial archangel as playing his
part with such excellent appetite at Adam's
dinner-table, and confining himself to fruit
and vegetables only, because, in those early
days of her housekeeping, Eve had no
more acceptable viands to set before him.
Milton, indeed, had a true English taste
for the pleasures of the table, though refined
by the lofty and poetic discipline to
which he had subjected himself. It is
delicately implied in the refection in Paradise,
and more substantially, though still
elegantly, betrayed in the sonnet proposing
to "Laurence, of virtuous father virtuous
son," a series of nice little dinners in
midwinter; and it blazes fully out in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
untasted banquet, which, elaborate as it
was, Satan tossed up in a trice from the
kitchen-ranges of Tartarus.</p>

<p>Among this people, indeed, so wise in
their generation, dinner has a kind of sanctity
quite independent of the dishes that
may be set upon the table; so that, if it be
only a mutton-chop, they treat it with due
reverence, and are rewarded with a degree
of enjoyment which such reckless devourers
as ourselves do not often find in our
richest abundance. It is good to see how
stanch they are after fifty or sixty years of
heroic eating, still relying upon their digestive
powers and indulging a vigorous
appetite; whereas an American has generally
lost the one and learned to distrust the
other long before reaching the earliest decline
of life; and thenceforward he makes
little account of his dinner, and dines at
his peril, if at all. I know not whether my
countrymen will allow me to tell them,
though I think it scarcely too much to affirm,
that on this side of the water people
never dine. At any rate, abundantly as
Nature has provided us with most of the
material requisites, the highest possible
dinner has never yet been eaten in America.
It is the consummate flower of civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
and refinement; and our inability
to produce it, or to appreciate its admirable
beauty if a happy inspiration should bring
it into bloom, marks fatally the limit of
culture which we have attained.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed, however, that
the mob of cultivated Englishmen know
how to dine in this elevated sense. The
unpolishable ruggedness of the national
character is still an impediment to them,
even in that particular line where they are
best qualified to excel. Though often present
at good men's feasts, I remember only a
single dinner, which, while lamentably conscious
that many of its higher excellences
were thrown away upon me, I yet could
feel to be a perfect work of art. It could
not, without unpardonable coarseness, be
styled a matter of animal enjoyment, because,
out of the very perfection of that
lower bliss, there had arisen a dream-like
development of spiritual happiness. As in
the masterpieces of painting and poetry,
there was a something intangible, a final
deliciousness that only fluttered about your
comprehension, vanishing whenever you
tried to detain it, and compelling you to
recognize it by faith rather than sense. It
seemed as if a diviner set of senses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
requisite, and had been partly supplied, for
the special fruition of this banquet, and
that the guests around the table (only eight
in number) were becoming so educated,
polished, and softened, by the delicate influences
of what they ate and drank, as to
be now a little more than mortal for the
nonce. And there was that gentle, delicious
sadness, too, which we find in the
very summit of our most exquisite enjoyments,
and feel it a charm beyond all the
gayety through which it keeps breathing
its undertone. In the present case, it was
worth a heavier sigh to reflect that such a
festal achievement&mdash;the production of so
much art, skill, fancy, invention, and perfect
taste&mdash;the growth of all the ages, which
appeared to have been ripening for this
hour, since man first began to eat and to
moisten his food with wine&mdash;must lavish
its happiness upon so brief a moment
when other beautiful things can be made a
joy forever. Yet a dinner like this is no
better than we can get, any day, at the
rejuvenescent Cornhill Coffee-house, unless
the whole man, with soul, intellect,
and stomach, is ready to appreciate it, and
unless, moreover, there is such a harmony
in all the circumstances and accompaniments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
and especially such a pitch of well-according
minds, that nothing shall jar
rudely against the guest's thoroughly awakened
sensibilities. The world, and especially
our part of it, being the rough, ill-assorted,
and tumultuous place we find it,
a beefsteak is about as good as any other
dinner.</p>

<p>The foregoing reminiscence, however,
has drawn me aside from the main object
of my sketch, in which I purposed to give
a slight idea of those public, or partially
public banquets, the custom of which so
thoroughly prevails among the English
people, that nothing is ever decided upon,
in matters of peace and war, until they
have chewed upon it in the shape of roast-beef,
and talked it fully over in their cups.
Nor are these festivities merely occasional,
but of stated recurrence in all considerable
municipalities and associated bodies. The
most ancient times appear to have been as
familiar with them as the Englishmen of
to-day. In many of the old English towns,
you find some stately Gothic hall or chamber
in which the Mayor and other authorities
of the place have long held their sessions;
and always, in convenient contiguity, there
is a dusky kitchen, with an immense fireplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
where an ox might lie roasting at his
ease, though the less gigantic scale of modern
cookery may now have permitted the
cobwebs to gather in its chimney. St.
Mary's Hall, in Coventry, is so good a
specimen of an ancient banqueting-room,
that perhaps I may profitably devote a page
or two to the description of it.</p>

<p>In a narrow street opposite to St. Michael's
Church, one of the three famous
spires of Coventry, you behold a medi&aelig;val
edifice, in the basement of which is such a
venerable and now deserted kitchen as I
have above alluded to, and, on the same
level, a cellar, with low stone pillars and intersecting
arches, like the crypt of a cathedral.
Passing up a well-worn staircase, the
oaken balustrade of which is as black as
ebony, you enter the fine old hall, some
sixty feet in length, and broad and lofty in
proportion. It is lighted by six windows
of modern stained glass, on one side, and
by the immense and magnificent arch of
another window at the farther end of the
room, its rich and ancient panes constituting
a genuine historical piece, in which
are represented some of the kingly personages
of old times, with their heraldic blazonries.
Not withstanding the colored light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
thus thrown into the hall, and though it
was noonday when I last saw it, the paneling
of black-oak, and some faded tapestry
that hung round the walls, together with
the cloudy vault of the roof above, made a
gloom, which the richness only illuminated
into more appreciable effect. The tapestry
is wrought with figures in the dress
of Henry VI.'s time (which is the date of
the hall), and is regarded by antiquaries as
authentic evidence both for the costume
of that epoch, and, I believe, for the actual
portraiture of men known in history. They
are as colorless as ghosts, however, and
vanish drearily into the old stitch-work of
their substance when you try to make them
out. Coats of arms were formerly emblazoned
all round the hall, but have been almost
rubbed out by people hanging their
overcoats against them, or by women with
dishclouts and scrubbing-brushes, obliterating
hereditary glories in their blind hostility
to dust and spiders' webs. Full-length
portraits of several English kings, Charles
II. being the earliest, hang on the walls;
and on the da&iuml;s, or elevated part of the
floor, stands an antique chair of state,
which several royal characters are traditionally
said to have occupied while feasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
here with their loyal subjects of Coventry.
It is roomy enough for a person of
kingly bulk, or even two such, but angular
and uncomfortable, reminding me of the
oaken settles which used to be seen in old-fashioned
New England kitchens.</p>

<p>Overhead, supported by a self-sustaining
power, without the aid of a single pillar, is
the original ceiling of oak, precisely similar
in shape to the roof of a barn, with all
the beams and rafters plainly to be seen.
At the remote height of sixty feet, you
hardly discern that they are carved with
figures of angels, and doubtless many other
devices, of which the admirable Gothic art
is wasted in the duskiness that has so long
been brooding there. Over the entrance
of the hall, opposite the great arched window,
the party-colored radiance of which
glimmers faintly through the interval, is a
gallery for minstrels; and a row of ancient
suits of armor is suspended from its balustrade.
It impresses me, too (for, having
gone so far, I would fain leave nothing
untouched upon), that I remember, somewhere
about these venerable precincts, a
picture of the Countess Godiva on horseback,
in which the artist has been so niggardly
of that illustrious lady's hair, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
if she had no ampler garniture, there was
certainly much need for the good people
of Coventry to shut their eyes. After all
my pains, I fear that I have made but a
poor hand at the description, as regards a
transference of the scene from my own
mind to the reader's. It gave me a most
vivid idea of antiquity that had been very
little tampered with; insomuch that, if a
group of steel-clad knights had come clanking
through the doorway, and a bearded and
beruffed old figure had handed in a stately
dame, rustling in gorgeous robes of a long-forgotten
fashion, unveiling a face of beauty
somewhat tarnished in the mouldy tomb,
yet stepping majestically to the trill of
harp and viol from the minstrels' gallery,
while the rusty armor responded with a
hollow ringing sound beneath,&mdash;why, I
should have felt that these shadows, once
so familiar with the spot, had a better right
in St. Mary's Hall than I, a stranger from
a far country which has no Past. But the
moral of the foregoing description is to
show how tenaciously this love of pompous
dinners, this reverence for dinner as a
sacred institution, has caught hold of the
English character; since, from the earliest
recognizable period, we find them building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
their civic banqueting-halls as magnificently
as their palaces or cathedrals.</p>

<p>I know not whether the hall just described
is now used for festive purposes,
but others of similar antiquity and splendor
still are. For example, there is Barber
Surgeons' Hall, in London, a very fine
old room, adorned with admirably carved
wood-work on the ceiling and walls. It is
also enriched with Holbein's masterpiece,
representing a grave assemblage of barbers
and surgeons, all portraits (with such extensive
beards that methinks one half of
the company might have been profitably
occupied in trimming the other), kneeling
before King Henry VIII. Sir Robert Peel
is said to have offered a thousand pounds
for the liberty of cutting out one of the
heads from this picture, he conditioning to
have a perfect facsimile painted in.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>room has many other pictures of distinguished
members of the company in long-past
times, and of some of the monarchs
and statesmen of England, all darkened with
age, but darkened into such ripe magnificence
as only age could bestow. It is not
my design to inflict any more specimens of
ancient hall-painting on the reader; but it
may be worth while to touch upon other
modes of stateliness that still survive in
these time-honored civic feasts, where there
appears to be a singular assumption of dignity
and solemn pomp by respectable citizens
who would never dream of claiming
any privilege of rank outside of their own
sphere. Thus, I saw two caps of state
for the warden and junior warden of the
company, caps of silver (real coronets or
crowns, indeed, for these city-grandees)
wrought in open-work and lined with crimson
velvet. In a strong-closet, opening
from the hall, there was a great deal of
rich plate to furnish forth the banquet-table,
comprising hundreds of forks and
spoons, a vast silver punch-bowl, the gift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>of some jolly king or other, and, besides
a multitude of less noticeable vessels, two
loving-cups, very elaborately wrought in
silver gilt, one presented by Henry VIII.,
the other by Charles II. These cups, including
the covers and pedestals, are very
large and weighty, although the bowl-part
would hardly contain more than half a pint
of wine, which, when the custom was first
established, each guest was probably expected
to drink off at a draught. In passing
them from hand to hand adown a long
table of compotators, there is a peculiar
ceremony which I may hereafter have occasion
to describe. Meanwhile, if I might
assume such a liberty, I should be glad to
invite the reader to the official dinner-table
of his Worship, the Mayor, at a large English
seaport where I spent several years.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> In this room hangs the most valuable picture by
Holbein now in existence, representing the company of
Barber Surgeons kneeling before Henry VIII., and receiving
their charter from his hands. The picture is
about six feet square. The king is dressed in scarlet,
and quite fulfills one's idea of his aspect. The Barber-Surgeons,
all portraits, are an assemblage of grave-looking
personages, in dark costumes. The company has
refused five thousand pounds for this unique picture;
and the keeper of the Hall told me that Sir Robert Peel
had offered a thousand pounds for liberty to take out
only one of the heads, that of a person named Penn, he
conditioning to have a perfect facsimile painted in. I
did not see any merit in this head over the others.&mdash;II. 200.</p></div>

<p>The Mayor's dinner-parties occur as
often as once a fortnight, and, inviting his
guests by fifty or sixty at a time, his Worship
probably assembles at his board most
of the eminent citizens and distinguished
personages of the town and neighborhood
more than once during his year's incumbency,
and very much, no doubt, to the
promotion of good feeling among individuals
of opposite parties and diverse pursuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
in life. A miscellaneous party of Englishmen
can always find more comfortable
ground to meet upon than as many Americans,
their differences of opinion being
incomparably less radical than ours, and it
being the sincerest wish of all their hearts,
whether they call themselves Liberals or
what not, that nothing in this world shall
ever be greatly altered from what it has
been and is. Thus there is seldom such a
virulence of political hostility that it may
not be dissolved in a glass or two of wine,
without making the good liquor any more
dry or bitter than accords with English
taste.</p>

<p>The first dinner of this kind at which I
had the honor to be present took place
during assize-time, and included among the
guests the judges and the prominent members
of the bar. Reaching the Town Hall
at seven o'clock, I communicated my name
to one of several splendidly dressed footmen,
and he repeated it to another on the
first staircase, by whom it was passed to a
third, and thence to a fourth at the door of
the reception-room, losing all resemblance
to the original sound in the course of these
transmissions; so that I had the advantage
of making my entrance in the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
a stranger, not only to the whole company,
but to myself as well. His Worship, however,
kindly recognized me, and put me on
speaking-terms with two or three gentlemen,
whom I found very affable, and all
the more hospitably attentive on the score
of my nationality. It is very singular how
kind an Englishman will almost invariably
be to an individual American, without ever
bating a jot of his prejudice against the
American character in the lump. My new
acquaintances took evident pains to put me
at my ease; and, in requital of their good-nature,
I soon began to look round at
the general company in a critical spirit,
making my crude observations apart, and
drawing silent inferences, of the correctness
of which I should not have been half
so well satisfied a year afterwards as at
that moment.</p>

<p>There were two judges present, a good
many lawyers, and a few officers of the
army in uniform. The other guests seemed
to be principally of the mercantile class,
and among them was a ship-owner from
Nova Scotia, with whom I coalesced a little,
inasmuch as we were born with the same
sky over our heads, and an unbroken continuity
of soil between his abode and mine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
There was one old gentleman, whose character
I never made out, with powdered hair,
clad in black breeches and silk stockings,
and wearing a rapier at his side; otherwise,
with the exception of the military uniforms,
there was little or no pretense of official
costume. It being the first considerable
assemblage of Englishmen that I had seen,
my honest impression about them was that
they were a heavy and homely set of people,
with a remarkable roughness of aspect and
behavior, not repulsive, but beneath which
it required more familiarity with the national
character than I then possessed
always to detect the good breeding of a
gentleman. Being generally middle-aged,
or still further advanced, they were by no
means graceful in figure; for the comeliness
of the youthful Englishman rapidly
diminishes with years, his body appearing
to grow longer, his legs to abbreviate themselves,
and his stomach to assume the dignified
prominence which justly belongs to
that metropolis of his system. His face
(what with the acridity of the atmosphere,
ale at lunch, wine at dinner, and a well-digested
abundance of succulent food) gets
red and mottled, and develops at least one
additional chin, with a promise of more;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
so that, finally, a stranger recognizes his
animal part at the most superficial glance,
but must take time and a little pains to
discover the intellectual. Comparing him
with an American, I really thought that
our national paleness and lean habit of
flesh gave us greatly the advantage in an
&aelig;sthetic point of view. It seemed to me,
moreover, that the English tailor had not
done so much as he might and ought for
these heavy figures, but had gone on willfully
exaggerating their uncouthness by the
roominess of their garments; he had evidently
no idea of accuracy of fit, and smartness
was entirely out of his line. But, to
be quite open with the reader, I afterwards
learned to think that this aforesaid tailor
has a deeper art than his brethren among
ourselves, knowing how to dress his customers
with such individual propriety that
they look as if they were born in their
clothes, the fit being to the character rather
than the form. If you make an Englishman
smart (unless he be a very exceptional
one, of whom I have seen a few), you make
him a monster; his best aspect is that of
ponderous respectability.</p>

<p>To make an end of these first impressions,
I fancied that not merely the Suffolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
bar, but the bar of any inland county in
New England, might show a set of thin-visaged
men looking wretchedly worn, sallow,
deeply wrinkled across the forehead,
and grimly furrowed about the mouth, with
whom these heavy-cheeked English lawyers,
slow-paced and fat-witted as they
must needs be, would stand very little
chance in a professional contest. How
that matter might turn out, I am unqualified
to decide. But I state these results
of my earliest glimpses at Englishmen, not
for what they are worth, but because I
ultimately gave them up as worth little or
nothing. In course of time, I came to the
conclusion that Englishmen of all ages are
a rather good-looking people, dress in admirable
taste from their own point of view,
and, under a surface never silken to the
touch, have a refinement of manners too
thorough and genuine to be thought of as
a separate endowment,&mdash;that is to say, if
the individual himself be a man of station,
and has had gentlemen for his father and
grandfather. The sturdy Anglo-Saxon
nature does not refine itself short of the
third generation. The tradesmen, too, and
all other classes, have their own proprieties.</p>

<p>The only value of my criticisms, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
lay in their exemplifying the proneness
of a traveler to measure one people by the
distinctive characteristics of another,&mdash;as
English writers invariably measure us, and
take upon themselves to be disgusted accordingly,
instead of trying to find out some
principle of beauty with which we may be
in conformity.</p>

<p>In due time we were summoned to the
table, and went thither in no solemn procession,
but with a good deal of jostling,
thrusting behind, and scrambling for places
when we reached our destination. The
legal gentlemen, I suspect, were responsible
for this indecorous zeal, which I never
afterwards remarked in a similar party.
The dining-hall was of noble size, and, like
the other rooms of the suite, was gorgeously
painted and gilded and brilliantly illuminated.
There was a splendid table-service,
and a noble array of footmen, some of
them in plain clothes, and others wearing
the town-livery, richly decorated with gold-lace,
and themselves excellent specimens of
the blooming young manhood of Britain.
When we were fairly seated, it was certainly
an agreeable spectacle to look up
and down the long vista of earnest faces,
and behold them so resolute, so conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
that there was an important business in
hand, and so determined to be equal to
the occasion. Indeed, Englishman or not,
I hardly know what can be prettier than
a snow-white tablecloth, a huge heap of
flowers as a central decoration, bright silver,
rich china, crystal glasses, decanters
of Sherry at due intervals, a French roll
and an artistically folded napkin at each
plate, all that airy portion of a banquet, in
short, that comes before the first mouthful,
the whole illuminated by a blaze of
artificial light, without which a dinner of
made-dishes looks spectral, and the simplest
viands are the best. Printed bills-of-fare
were distributed, representing an abundant
feast, no part of which appeared on the
table until called for in separate plates. I
have entirely forgotten what it was, but
deem it no great matter, inasmuch as there
is a pervading commonplace and identicalness
in the composition of extensive dinners,
on account of the impossibility of
supplying a hundred guests with anything
particularly delicate or rare. It was suggested
to me that certain juicy old gentlemen
had a private understanding what to
call for, and that it would be good policy
in a stranger to follow in their footsteps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
through the feast. I did not care to do so,
however, because, like Sancho Panza's dip
out of Camacho's caldron, any sort of potluck
at such a table would be sure to suit
my purpose; so I chose a dish or two on
my own judgment, and, getting through
my labors betimes, had great pleasure in
seeing the Englishmen toil onward to the
end.</p>

<p>They drank rather copiously, too, though
wisely; for I observed that they seldom
took Hock, and let the Champagne bubble
slowly away out of the goblet, solacing
themselves with Sherry, but tasting it
warily before bestowing their final confidence.
Their taste in wines, however, did
not seem so exquisite, and certainly was
not so various, as that to which many
Americans pretend. This foppery of an
intimate acquaintance with rare vintages
does not suit a sensible Englishman, as
he is very much in earnest about his
wines, and adopts one or two as his lifelong
friends, seldom exchanging them for
any Delilahs of a moment, and reaping the
reward of his constancy in an unimpaired
stomach, and only so much gout as he
deems wholesome and desirable. Knowing
well the measure of his powers, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
not apt to fill his glass too often. Society,
indeed, would hardly tolerate habitual imprudences
of that kind, though, in my opinion,
the Englishmen now upon the stage
could carry off their three bottles, at need,
with as steady a gait as any of their forefathers.
It is not so very long since the
three-bottle heroes sank finally under the
table. It may be (at least, I should be
glad if it were true) that there was an occult
sympathy between our temperance
reform, now somewhat in abeyance, and
the almost simultaneous disappearance of
hard-drinking among the respectable
classes in England. I remember a middle-aged
gentleman telling me (in illustration
of the very slight importance attached to
breaches of temperance within the memory
of men not yet old) that he had seen
a certain magistrate, Sir John Linkwater,
or Drinkwater,&mdash;but I think the jolly old
knight could hardly have staggered under
so perverse a misnomer as this last,&mdash;while
sitting on the magisterial bench, pull
out a crown-piece and hand it to the clerk.
"Mr. Clerk," said Sir John, as if it were
the most indifferent fact in the world, "I
was drunk last night. There are my five
shillings."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>During the dinner, I had a good deal of
pleasant conversation with the gentlemen
on either side of me. One of them, a lawyer,
expatiated with great unction on the
social standing of the judges. Representing
the dignity and authority of the Crown,
they take precedence, during assize-time,
of the highest military men in the kingdom,
of the Lord Lieutenant of the county,
of the Archbishops, of the royal Dukes,
and even of the Prince of Wales. For
the nonce, they are the greatest men in
England. With a glow of professional
complacency that amounted to enthusiasm,
my friend assured me, that, in case of a
royal dinner, a judge, if actually holding
an assize, would be expected to offer his
arm and take the Queen herself to the
table. Happening to be in company with
some of these elevated personages, on subsequent
occasions, it appeared to me that
the judges are fully conscious of their
paramount claims to respect, and take
rather more pains to impress them on
their ceremonial inferiors than men of
high hereditary rank are apt to do. Bishops,
if it be not irreverent to say so, are
sometimes marked by a similar characteristic.
Dignified position is so sweet to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
Englishman, that he needs to be born in it,
and to feel it thoroughly incorporated with
his nature from its original germ, in order
to keep him from flaunting it obtrusively
in the faces of innocent by-standers.</p>

<p>My companion on the other side was a
thick-set, middle-aged man, uncouth in manners,
and ugly where none were handsome,
with a dark, roughly hewn visage, that
looked grim in repose, and seemed to hold
within itself the machinery of a very terrific
frown. He ate with resolute appetite,
and let slip few opportunities of imbibing
whatever liquids happened to be passing
by. I was meditating in what way this
grisly featured table-fellow might most
safely be accosted, when he turned to me
with a surly sort of kindness, and invited
me to take a glass of wine. We then
began a conversation that abounded, on his
part, with sturdy sense, and, somehow or
other, brought me closer to him than I
had yet stood to an Englishman. I should
hardly have taken him to be an educated
man, certainly not a scholar of accurate
training; and yet he seemed to have all
the resources of education and trained intellectual
power at command. My fresh
Americanism, and watchful observation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
English characteristics, appeared either to
interest or amuse him, or perhaps both.
Under the mollifying influences of abundance
of meat and drink, he grew very
gracious (not that I ought to use such a
phrase to describe his evidently genuine
good-will), and by and by expressed a wish
for further acquaintance, asking me to call
at his rooms in London and inquire for
Sergeant Wilkins,&mdash;throwing out the name
forcibly, as if he had no occasion to be
ashamed of it. I remembered Dean Swift's
retort to Sergeant Bettesworth on a similar
announcement,&mdash;"Of what regiment, pray,
sir?"&mdash;and fancied that the same question
might not have been quite amiss, if applied
to the rugged individual at my side. But
I heard of him subsequently as one of the
prominent men at the English bar, a rough
customer, and a terribly strong champion in
criminal cases; and it caused me more regret
than might have been expected, on so
slight an acquaintanceship, when, not long
afterwards, I saw his death announced in
the newspapers. Not rich in attractive
qualities, he possessed, I think, the most
attractive one of all,&mdash;thorough manhood.</p>

<p>After the cloth was removed, a goodly
group of decanters were set before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
Mayor, who sent them forth on their outward
voyage, full freighted with Port,
Sherry, Madeira, and Claret, of which excellent
liquors, methought, the latter found
least acceptance among the guests. When
every man had filled his glass, his Worship
stood up and proposed a toast. It was, of
course, "Our gracious Sovereign," or words
to that effect; and immediately a band of
musicians, whose preliminary tootings and
thrummings I had already heard behind
me, struck up "God save the Queen!" and
the whole company rose with one impulse
to assist in singing that famous national
anthem. It was the first time in my life
that I had ever seen a body of men, or
even a single man, under the active influence
of the sentiment of Loyalty; for,
though we call ourselves loyal to our country
and institutions, and prove it by our
readiness to shed blood and sacrifice life in
their behalf, still the principle is as cold
and hard, in an American bosom, as the
steel spring that puts in motion a powerful
machinery. In the Englishman's system,
a force similar to that of our steel spring
is generated by the warm throbbings of
human hearts. He clothes our bare abstraction
in flesh and blood,&mdash;at present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
in the flesh and blood of a woman,&mdash;and
manages to combine love, awe, and intellectual
reverence, all in one emotion, and
to embody his mother, his wife, his children,
the whole idea of kindred, in a single
person, and make her the representative of
his country and its laws. We Americans
smile superior, as I did at the Mayor's
table; and yet, I fancy, we lose some very
agreeable titillations of the heart in consequence
of our proud prerogative of caring
no more about our President than for a
man of straw, or a stuffed scarecrow straddling
in a cornfield.</p>

<p>But, to say the truth, the spectacle
struck me rather ludicrously, to see this
party of stout middle-aged and elderly gentlemen,
in the fullness of meat and drink,
their ample and ruddy faces glistening with
wine, perspiration, and enthusiasm, rumbling
out those strange old stanzas from the
very bottom of their hearts and stomachs,
which two organs, in the English interior
arrangement, lie closer together than in
ours. The song seemed to me the rudest
old ditty in the world; but I could not wonder
at its universal acceptance and indestructible
popularity, considering how inimitably
it expresses the national faith and feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
as regards the inevitable righteousness of
England, the Almighty's consequent respect
and partiality for that redoubtable
little island, and his presumed readiness to
strengthen its defense against the contumacious
wickedness and knavery of all
other principalities or republics. Tennyson
himself, though evidently English to
the very last prejudice, could not write half
so good a song for the purpose. Finding
that the entire dinner-table struck in, with
voices of every pitch between rolling thunder
and the squeak of a cart-wheel, and that
the strain was not of such delicacy as to be
much hurt by the harshest of them, I determined
to lend my own assistance in
swelling the triumphant roar. It seemed
but a proper courtesy to the first Lady in
the land, whose guest, in the largest sense,
I might consider myself. Accordingly, my
first tuneful efforts (and probably my last,
for I purpose not to sing any more, unless
it be "Hail Columbia" on the restoration
of the Union) were poured freely forth in
honor of Queen Victoria. The Sergeant
smiled like the carved head of a Swiss
nutcracker, and the other gentlemen in
my neighborhood, by nods and gestures,
evinced grave approbation of so suitable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
tribute to English superiority; and we finished
our stave and sat down in an extremely
happy frame of mind.</p>

<p>Other toasts followed in honor of the
great institutions and interests of the country,
and speeches in response to each were
made by individuals whom the Mayor designated
or the company called for. None
of them impressed me with a very high
idea of English post-prandial oratory. It
is inconceivable, indeed, what ragged and
shapeless utterances most Englishmen are
satisfied to give vent to, without attempting
anything like artistic shape, but clapping
on a patch here and another there,
and ultimately getting out what they want
to say, and generally with a result of sufficiently
good sense, but in some such disorganized
mass as if they had thrown it up
rather than spoken it. It seemed to me
that this was almost as much by choice
as necessity. An Englishman, ambitious
of public favor, should not be too smooth.
If an orator is glib, his countrymen distrust
him. They dislike smartness. The
stronger and heavier his thoughts, the
better, provided there be an element of
commonplace running through them; and
any rough, yet never vulgar, force of expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
such as would knock an opponent
down if it hit him, only it must not be too
personal, is altogether to their taste; but a
studied neatness of language, or other such
superficial graces, they cannot abide. They
do not often permit a man to make himself
a fine orator of malice aforethought, that is,
unless he be a nobleman (as, for example,
Lord Stanley, of the Derby family), who,
as an hereditary legislator and necessarily
a public speaker, is bound to remedy a poor
natural delivery in the best way he can.
On the whole, I partly agree with them,
and, if I cared for any oratory whatever,
should be as likely to applaud theirs as our
own. When an English speaker sits down,
you feel that you have been listening to
a real man, and not to an actor; his sentiments
have a wholesome earth-smell in
them, though, very likely, this apparent
naturalness is as much an art as what we
expend in rounding a sentence or elaborating
a peroration.</p>

<p>It is one good effect of this inartificial
style, that nobody in England seems to
feel any shyness about shoveling the untrimmed
and untrimmable ideas out of his
mind for the benefit of an audience. At
least, nobody did on the occasion now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
hand, except a poor little Major of Artillery,
who responded for the Army in a
thin, quavering voice, with a terribly hesitating
trickle of fragmentary ideas, and, I
question not, would rather have been bayoneted
in front of his batteries than to have
said a word. Not his own mouth, but
the cannon's, was this poor Major's proper
organ of utterance.</p>

<p>While I was thus amiably occupied in
criticising my fellow-guests, the Mayor
had got up to propose another toast; and
listening rather inattentively to the first
sentence or two, I soon became sensible of
a drift in his Worship's remarks that made
me glance apprehensively towards Sergeant
Wilkins. "Yes," grumbled that gruff personage,
shoving a decanter of Port towards
me, "it is your turn next;" and seeing in
my face, I suppose, the consternation of a
wholly unpracticed orator, he kindly added,
"It is nothing. A mere acknowledgment
will answer the purpose. The less you
say, the better they will like it." That
being the case, I suggested that perhaps
they would like it best if I said nothing
at all. But the Sergeant shook his head.
Now, on first receiving the Mayor's invitation
to dinner, it had occurred to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
I might possibly be brought into my present
predicament; but I had dismissed the
idea from my mind as too disagreeable to
be entertained, and, moreover, as so alien
from my disposition and character that
Fate surely could not keep such a misfortune
in store for me. If nothing else prevented,
an earthquake or the crack of doom
would certainly interfere before I need rise
to speak. Yet here was the Mayor getting
on inexorably,&mdash;and, indeed, I heartily
wished that he might get on and on forever,
and of his wordy wanderings find no
end.</p>

<p>If the gentle reader, my kindest friend
and closest confidant, deigns to desire it, I
can impart to him my own experience as
a public speaker quite as indifferently as
if it concerned another person. Indeed, it
does concern another, or a mere spectral
phenomenon, for it was not I, in my proper
and natural self, that sat there at table or
subsequently rose to speak. At the moment,
then, if the choice had been offered
me whether the Mayor should let off a
speech at my head or a pistol, I should
unhesitatingly have taken the latter alternative.
I had really nothing to say, not an
idea in my head, nor, which was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
deal worse, any flowing words or embroidered
sentences in which to dress out that
empty Nothing, and give it a cunning aspect
of intelligence, such as might last the
poor vacuity the little time it had to live.
But time pressed; the Mayor brought his
remarks, affectionately eulogistic of the
United States and highly complimentary
to their distinguished representative at
that table, to a close, amid a vast deal of
cheering; and the band struck up "Hail
Columbia," I believe, though it might have
been "Old Hundred," or "God save the
Queen" over again, for anything that I
should have known or cared. When the
music ceased, there was an intensely disagreeable
instant, during which I seemed
to rend away and fling off the habit of a
lifetime, and rose, still void of ideas, but
with preternatural composure, to make a
speech. The guests rattled on the table,
and cried, "Hear!" most vociferously, as
if now, at length, in this foolish and idly
garrulous world, had come the long-expected
moment when one golden word was
to be spoken; and in that imminent crisis,
I caught a glimpse of a little bit of an effusion
of international sentiment, which it
might, and must, and should do to utter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span></p>

<p>Well; it was nothing, as the Sergeant
had said. What surprised me most was
the sound of my own voice, which I had
never before heard at declamatory pitch,
and which impressed me as belonging to
some other person, who, and not myself,
would be responsible for the speech: a
prodigious consolation and encouragement
under the circumstances! I went on without
the slightest embarrassment, and sat
down amid great applause, wholly undeserved
by anything that I had spoken, but
well won from Englishmen, methought, by
the new development of pluck that alone
had enabled me to speak at all. "It was
handsomely done!" quoth Sergeant Wilkins;
and I felt like a recruit who had
been for the first time under fire.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Anybody may make an after-dinner speech who will
be content to talk onward without saying anything. My
speech was not more than two or three inches long;
and, considering that I did not know a soul there, except
the Mayor himself, and that I am wholly unpracticed
in all sorts of oratory, and that I had nothing to
say, it was quite successful. I hardly thought it was in
me, but, being once started, I felt no embarrassment,
and went through it as coolly as if I were going to be
hanged.&mdash;I. 429.</p></div>

<p>I would gladly have ended my oratorical
career then and there forever, but was
often placed in a similar or worse position,
and compelled to meet it as I best might;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>for this was one of the necessities of an
office which I had voluntarily taken on my
shoulders, and beneath which I might be
crushed by no moral delinquency on my
own part, but could not shirk without cowardice
and shame. My subsequent fortune
was various. Once, though I felt it
to be a kind of imposture, I got a speech
by heart, and doubtless it might have been
a very pretty one, only I forgot every syllable
at the moment of need, and had to improvise
another as well as I could. I found
it a better method to prearrange a few
points in my mind, and trust to the spur
of the occasion, and the kind aid of Providence,
for enabling me to bring them to
bear. The presence of any considerable
proportion of personal friends generally
dumfounded me. I would rather have
talked with an enemy in the gate. Invariably,
too, I was much embarrassed by a
small audience, and succeeded better with
a large one,&mdash;the sympathy of a multitude
possessing a buoyant effect, which lifts the
speaker a little way out of his individuality,
and tosses him towards a perhaps
better range of sentiment than his private
one. Again, if I rose carelessly and
confidently, with an expectation of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
through the business entirely at my ease,
I often found that I had little or nothing
to say; whereas, if I came to the charge
in perfect despair, and at a crisis when
failure would have been horrible, it once
or twice happened that the frightful emergency
concentrated my poor faculties, and
enabled me to give definite and vigorous
expression to sentiments which an instant
before looked as vague and far off as the
clouds in the atmosphere. On the whole,
poor as my own success may have been, I
apprehend that any intelligent man with a
tongue possesses the chief requisite of oratorical
power, and may develop many of
the others, if he deems it worth while to
bestow a great amount of labor and pains
on an object which the most accomplished
orators, I suspect, have not found altogether
satisfactory to their highest impulses.
At any rate, it must be a remarkably
true man who can keep his own
elevated conception of truth when the
lower feeling of a multitude is assailing his
natural sympathies, and who can speak out
frankly the best that there is in him, when
by adulterating it a little, or a good deal,
he knows that he may make it ten times
as acceptable to the audience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>This slight article on the civic banquets
of England would be too wretchedly imperfect
without an attempted description of a
Lord Mayor's dinner at the Mansion House
in London. I should have preferred the
annual feast at Guildhall, but never had
the good fortune to witness it. Once, however,
I was honored with an invitation to
one of the regular dinners, and gladly accepted
it,&mdash;taking the precaution, nevertheless,
though it hardly seemed necessary,
to inform the City-King, through a mutual
friend, that I was no fit representative
of American eloquence, and must humbly
make it a condition that I should not be
expected to open my mouth, except for the
reception of his Lordship's bountiful hospitality.
The reply was gracious and acquiescent;
so that I presented myself in the
great entrance-hall of the Mansion House,
at half-past six o'clock, in a state of most
enjoyable freedom from the pusillanimous
apprehensions that often tormented me
at such times. The Mansion House was
built in Queen Anne's days, in the very
heart of old London, and is a palace worthy
of its inhabitant, were he really as great
a man as his traditionary state and pomp
would seem to indicate. Times are changed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
however, since the days of Whittington, or
even of Hogarth's Industrious Apprentice,
to whom the highest imaginable reward of
lifelong integrity was a seat in the Lord
Mayor's chair. People nowadays say that
the real dignity and importance have perished
out of the office, as they do, sooner or
later, out of all earthly institutions, leaving
only a painted and gilded shell like that of
an Easter egg, and that it is only second-rate
and third-rate men who now condescend
to be ambitious of the Mayoralty.
I felt a little grieved at this; for the original
emigrants of New England had strong
sympathies with the people of London, who
were mostly Puritans in religion and Parliamentarians
in politics, in the early days
of our country; so that the Lord Mayor was
a potentate of huge dimensions in the estimation
of our forefathers, and held to be
hardly second to the prime minister of the
throne. The true great men of the city
now appear to have aims beyond city greatness,
connecting themselves with national
politics, and seeking to be identified with
the aristocracy of the country.</p>

<p>In the entrance-hall I was received by
a body of footmen dressed in a livery of
blue coats and buff breeches, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
they looked wonderfully like American
Revolutionary generals, only bedizened
with far more lace and embroidery than
those simple and grand old heroes ever
dreamed of wearing. There were likewise
two very imposing figures, whom I should
have taken to be military men of rank, being
arrayed in scarlet coats and large silver
epaulets; but they turned out to be officers
of the Lord Mayor's household, and were
now employed in assigning to the guests
the places which they were respectively to
occupy at the dinner-table. Our names
(for I had included myself in a little group
of friends) were announced; and ascending
the staircase, we met his Lordship in the
doorway of the first reception-room, where,
also, we had the advantage of a presentation
to the Lady Mayoress. As this distinguished
couple retired into private life
at the termination of their year of office, it
is inadmissible to make any remarks, critical
or laudatory, on the manners and bearing
of two personages suddenly emerging
from a position of respectable mediocrity
into one of pre&euml;minent dignity within
their own sphere. Such individuals almost
always seem to grow nearly or quite to
the full size of their office. If it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
desirable to write an essay on the latent
aptitude of ordinary people for grandeur,
we have an exemplification in our own
country, and on a scale incomparably
greater than that of the Mayoralty, though
invested with nothing like the outward
magnificence that gilds and embroiders the
latter. If I have been correctly informed,
the Lord Mayor's salary is exactly double
that of the President of the United States,
and yet is found very inadequate to his necessary
expenditure.</p>

<p>There were two reception-rooms, thrown
into one by the opening of wide folding-doors;
and though in an old style, and not
yet so old as to be venerable, they are
remarkably handsome apartments, lofty as
well as spacious, with carved ceilings and
walls, and at either end a splendid fireplace
of white marble, ornamented with sculptured
wreaths of flowers and foliage. The
company were about three hundred, many
of them celebrities in politics, war, literature,
and science, though I recollect none
pre&euml;minently distinguished in either department.
But it is certainly a pleasant
mode of doing honor to men of literature,
for example, who deserve well of the public,
yet do not often meet it face to face, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
to bring them together under genial auspices,
in connection with persons of note
in other lines. I know not what may be
the Lord Mayor's mode or principle of
selecting his guests, nor whether, during
his official term, he can proffer his hospitality
to every man of noticeable talent
in the wide world of London, nor, in fine,
whether his Lordship's invitation is much
sought for or valued; but it seemed to me
that this periodical feast is one of the many
sagacious methods which the English have
contrived for keeping up a good understanding
among different sorts of people.
Like most other distinctions of society,
however, I presume that the Lord Mayor's
card does not often seek out modest merit,
but comes at last when the recipient is
conscious of the bore, and doubtful about
the honor.</p>

<p>One very pleasant characteristic, which
I never met with at any other public or
partially public dinner, was the presence
of ladies. No doubt, they were principally
the wives and daughters of city magnates;
and if we may judge from the many sly
allusions in old plays and satirical poems,
the city of London has always been famous
for the beauty of its women and the reciprocal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
attractions between them and the
men of quality. Be that as it might, while
straying hither and thither through those
crowded apartments, I saw much reason for
modifying certain heterodox opinions which
I had imbibed, in my Transatlantic newness
and rawness, as regarded the delicate
character and frequent occurrence of English
beauty. To state the entire truth
(being, at this period, some years old in
English life), my taste, I fear, had long
since begun to be deteriorated by acquaintance
with other models of feminine loveliness
than it was my happiness to know
in America. I often found, or seemed to
find, if I may dare to confess it, in the
persons of such of my dear countrywomen
as I now occasionally met, a certain meagreness
(Heaven forbid that I should call
it scrawniness!), a deficiency of physical
development, a scantiness, so to speak, in
the pattern of their material make, a paleness
of complexion, a thinness of voice,&mdash;all
of which characteristics, nevertheless,
only made me resolve so much the more
sturdily to uphold these fair creatures as
angels, because I was sometimes driven to
a half-acknowledgment that the English
ladies, looked at from a lower point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
view, were perhaps a little finer animals
than they. The advantages of the latter,
if any they could really be said to have,
were all comprised in a few additional
lumps of clay on their shoulders and other
parts of their figures. It would be a pitiful
bargain to give up the ethereal charm
of American beauty in exchange for half a
hundred-weight of human clay!</p>

<p>At a given signal we all found our way
into an immense room, called the Egyptian
Hall, I know not why, except that the
architecture was classic, and as different
as possible from the ponderous style of
Memphis and the Pyramids. A powerful
band played inspiringly as we entered, and
a brilliant profusion of light shone down
on two long tables, extending the whole
length of the hall, and a cross-table between
them, occupying nearly its entire
breadth. Glass gleamed and silver glistened
on an acre or two of snowy damask,
over which were set out all the accompaniments
of a stately feast. We found our
places without much difficulty, and the
Lord Mayor's chaplain implored a blessing
on the food,&mdash;a ceremony which the English
never omit, at a great dinner or a
small one, yet consider, I fear, not so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
a religious rite as a sort of preliminary
relish before the soup.</p>

<p>The soup, of course, on this occasion,
was turtle, of which, in accordance with
immemorial custom, each guest was allowed
two platefuls, in spite of the otherwise immitigable
law of table-decorum. Indeed,
judging from the proceedings of the
gentlemen near me, I surmised that there
was no practical limit, except the appetite
of the guests and the capacity of the soup-tureens.
Not being fond of this civic
dainty, I partook of it but once, and then
only in accordance with the wise maxim,
always to taste a fruit, a wine, or a celebrated
dish, at its indigenous site; and the
fountain-head of turtle-soup, I suppose, is
in the Lord Mayor's dinner-pot. It is one
of those orthodox customs which people
follow for half a century without knowing
why, to drink a sip of rum-punch, in a very
small tumbler, after the soup. It was excellently
well-brewed, and it seemed to me
almost worth while to sup the soup for the
sake of sipping the punch. The rest of
the dinner was catalogued in a bill-of-fare
printed on delicate white paper within an
arabesque border of green and gold. It
looked very good, not only in the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
and French names of the numerous dishes,
but also in the positive reality of the dishes
themselves, which were all set on the table
to be carved and distributed by the guests.
This ancient and honest method is attended
with a good deal of trouble, and a lavish
effusion of gravy, yet by no means bestowed
or dispensed in vain, because you
have thereby the absolute assurance of a
banquet actually before your eyes, instead
of a shadowy promise in the bill-of-fare,
and such meagre fulfillment as a single
guest can contrive to get upon his individual
plate. I wonder that Englishmen, who
are fond of looking at prize-oxen in the
shape of butcher's meat, do not generally
better estimate the &aelig;sthetic gormandism
of devouring the whole dinner with their
eyesight, before proceeding to nibble the
comparatively few morsels which, after all,
the most heroic appetite and widest stomachic
capacity of mere mortals can enable
even an alderman really to eat. There fell
to my lot three delectable things enough,
which I take pains to remember, that the
reader may not go away wholly unsatisfied
from the Barmecide feast to which I have
bidden him,&mdash;a red mullet, a plate of
mushrooms, exquisitely stewed, and part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
a ptarmigan, a bird of the same family as
the grouse, but feeding high up towards
the summit of the Scotch mountains,
whence it gets a wild delicacy of flavor
very superior to that of the artificially nurtured
English game-fowl. All the other
dainties have vanished from my memory
as completely as those of Prospero's banquet
after Ariel had clapped his wings
over it. The band played at intervals inspiriting
us to new efforts, as did likewise
the sparkling wines which the footmen
supplied from an inexhaustible cellar, and
which the guests quaffed with little apparent
reference to the disagreeable fact that
there comes a to-morrow morning after
every feast. As long as that shall be the
case, a prudent man can never have full
enjoyment of his dinner.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite to me, on the other side
of the table, sat a young lady in white,
whom I am sorely tempted to describe,
but dare not, because not only the super-eminence
of her beauty, but its peculiar
character, would cause the sketch to be
recognized, however rudely it might be
drawn. I hardly thought that there existed
such a woman outside of a picture-frame,
or the covers of a romance: not that I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
ever met with her resemblance even there,
but, being so distinct and singular an apparition,
she seemed likelier to find her
sisterhood in poetry and picture than in
real life. Let us turn away from her, lest
a touch too apt should compel her stately
and cold and soft and womanly grace to
gleam out upon my page with a strange
repulsion and unattainableness in the very
spell that made her beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>side, and familiarly attentive to her, sat
a gentleman of whom I remember only a
hard outline of the nose and forehead, and
such a monstrous portent of a beard that
you could discover no symptom of a mouth,
except when he opened it to speak, or to
put in a morsel of food. Then, indeed, you
suddenly became aware of a cave hidden
behind the impervious and darksome shrubbery.
There could be no doubt who this
gentleman and lady were. Any child would
have recognized them at a glance. It was
Bluebeard and a new wife (the loveliest of
the series, but with already a mysterious
gloom overshadowing her fair young brow)
traveling in their honeymoon, and dining,
among other distinguished strangers, at the
Lord Mayor's table.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> My eyes were mostly drawn to a young lady, who
sat nearly opposite me, across the table. She was, I
suppose, dark, and yet not dark, but rather seemed to
be of pure white marble, yet not white; but the purest
and finest complexion, without a shade of color in it, yet
anything but sallow or sickly. Her hair was a wonderful
deep raven-black, black as night, black as death; not
raven-black, for that has a shiny gloss, and hers had
not, but it was hair never to be painted nor described,&mdash;wonderful
hair, Jewish hair. Her nose had a beautiful
outline, though I could see that it was Jewish too;
and that, and all her features, were so fine that sculpture
seemed a despicable art beside her, and certainly my pen
is good for nothing. If any likeness could be given,
however, it must be by sculpture, not painting. She
was slender and youthful, and yet had a stately and
cold, though soft and womanly grace; and, looking at
her, I saw what were the wives of the old patriarchs in
their maiden or early-married days,&mdash;what Judith was,
for, womanly as she looked, I doubt not she could have
slain a man in a just cause,&mdash;what Bathsheba was, only
she seemed to have no sin in her,&mdash;perhaps what Eve
was, though one could hardly think her weak enough to
eat the apple.... Whether owing to distinctness of
race, my sense that she was a Jewess, or whatever else,
I felt a sort of repugnance, simultaneously with my perception
that she was an admirable creature.&mdash;II. 238.</p></div>

<p>After an hour or two of valiant achievement
with knife and fork came the dessert;
and at the point of the festival where
finger-glasses are usually introduced, a
large silver basin was carried round to the
guests, containing rose-water, into which
we dipped the ends of our napkins and
were conscious of a delightful fragrance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>instead of that heavy and weary odor, the
hateful ghost of a defunct dinner. This
seems to be an ancient custom of the
city, not confined to the Lord Mayor's
table, but never met with westward of
Temple Bar.</p>

<p>During all the feast, in accordance with
another ancient custom, the origin or purport
of which I do not remember to have
heard, there stood a man in armor, with a
helmet on his head, behind his Lordship's
chair. When the after-dinner wine was
placed on the table, still another official
personage appeared behind the chair, and
proceeded to make a solemn and sonorous
proclamation (in which he enumerated the
principal guests, comprising three or four
noblemen, several baronets, and plenty of
generals, members of Parliament, aldermen,
and other names of the illustrious, one of
which sounded strangely familiar to my
ears), ending in some such style as this:
"and other gentlemen and ladies, here
present, the Lord Mayor drinks to you all
in a loving-cup,"&mdash;giving a sort of sentimental
twang to the two words,&mdash;"and
sends it round among you!" And forthwith
the loving-cup&mdash;several of them,
indeed, on each side of the tables&mdash;came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
slowly down with all the antique ceremony.</p>

<p>The fashion of it is thus. The Lord
Mayor, standing up and taking the covered
cup in both hands, presents it to the guest
at his elbow, who likewise rises, and removes
the cover for his Lordship to drink,
which being successfully accomplished, the
guest replaces the cover and receives the
cup into his own hands. He then presents
it to his next neighbor, that the cover may
be again removed for himself to take a
draught, after which the third person goes
through a similar man&oelig;uvre with a fourth,
and he with a fifth, until the whole company
find themselves inextricably inter-twisted
and entangled in one complicated
chain of love. When the cup came to my
hands, I examined it critically, both inside
and out, and perceived it to be an antique
and richly ornamented silver goblet, capable
of holding about a quart of wine. Considering
how much trouble we all expended
in getting the cup to our lips, the guests
appeared to content themselves with wonderfully
moderate potations. In truth,
nearly or quite the original quart of wine
being still in the goblet, it seemed doubtful
whether any of the company had more
than barely touched the silver rim before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
passing it to their neighbors,&mdash;a degree of
abstinence that might be accounted for by
a fastidious repugnance to so many compotators
in one cup, or possibly by a disapprobation
of the liquor. Being curious to
know all about these important matters,
with a view of recommending to my
countrymen whatever they might usefully
adopt, I drank an honest sip from the loving-cup,
and had no occasion for another,&mdash;ascertaining
it to be Claret of a poor
original quality, largely mingled with water,
and spiced and sweetened. It was good
enough, however, for a merely spectral or
ceremonial drink, and could never have
been intended for any better purpose.</p>

<p>The toasts now began in the customary
order, attended with speeches neither more
nor less witty and ingenious than the specimens
of table eloquence which had heretofore
delighted me. As preparatory to
each new display, the herald, or whatever
he was, behind the chair of state, gave
awful notice that the Right Honorable
the Lord Mayor was about to propose
a toast. His Lordship being happily delivered
thereof, together with some accompanying
remarks, the band played an
appropriate tune, and the herald again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
issued proclamation to the effect that such
or such a nobleman, or gentleman, general,
dignified clergyman, or what not, was going
to respond to the Right Honorable the
Lord Mayor's toast; then, if I mistake not,
there was another prodigious flourish of
trumpets and twanging of stringed instruments;
and, finally, the doomed individual,
waiting all this while to be decapitated,
got up and proceeded to make a fool of
himself. A bashful young earl tried his
maiden oratory on the good citizens of
London, and, having evidently got every
word by heart (even including, however
he managed it, the most seemingly casual
improvisations of the moment), he really
spoke like a book, and made incomparably
the smoothest speech I ever heard in England.</p>

<p>The weight and gravity of the speakers,
not only on this occasion, but all similar
ones, was what impressed me as most
extraordinary, not to say absurd. Why
should people eat a good dinner, and put
their spirits into festive trim with Champagne,
and afterwards mellow themselves
into a most enjoyable state of quietude
with copious libations of Sherry and old
Port, and then disturb the whole excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
result by listening to speeches as heavy as
an after-dinner nap, and in no degree so
refreshing? If the Champagne had thrown
its sparkle over the surface of these effusions,
or if the generous Port had shone
through their substance with a ruddy glow
of the old English humor, I might have
seen a reason for honest gentlemen prattling
in their cups, and should undoubtedly
have been glad to be a listener. But there
was no attempt nor impulse of the kind on
the part of the orators, nor apparent expectation
of such a phenomenon on that of
the audience. In fact, I imagine that the
latter were best pleased when the speaker
embodied his ideas in the figurative language
of arithmetic, or struck upon any
hard matter of business or statistics, as
a heavy-laden bark bumps upon a rock
in mid-ocean.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The sad severity, the too
earnest utilitarianism, of modern life, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>wrought a radical and lamentable change,
I am afraid, in this ancient and goodly
institution of civic banquets. People used
to come to them, a few hundred years ago,
for the sake of being jolly; they come now
with an odd notion of pouring sober wisdom
into their wine by way of wormwood-bitters,
and thus make such a mess of it
that the wine and wisdom reciprocally
spoil one another.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> I rather think that Englishmen would purposely
avoid eloquence or neatness in after-dinner speeches. It
seems to be no part of their object. Yet any Englishman
almost, much more generally than Americans, will
stand up and talk on in a plain way, uttering one rough,
ragged, and shapeless sentence after another, and will
have expressed himself sensibly, though in a very rude
manner, before he sits down. And this is quite satisfactory
to his audience, who, indeed, are rather prejudiced
against the man who speaks too glibly.&mdash;I. 540.</p></div>

<p>Possibly, the foregoing sentiments have
taken a spice of acridity from a circumstance
that happened about this stage of
the feast, and very much interrupted my
own further enjoyment of it. Up to this
time, my condition had been exceedingly
felicitous, both on account of the brilliancy
of the scene, and because I was in close
proximity with three very pleasant English
friends. One of them was a lady, whose
honored name my readers would recognize
as a household word, if I dared write it;
another, a gentleman, likewise well known
to them, whose fine taste, kind heart, and
genial cultivation are qualities seldom
mixed in such happy proportion as in him.
The third was the man to whom I owed
most in England, the warm benignity of
whose nature was never weary of doing me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
good, who led me to many scenes of life,
in town, camp, and country, which I never
could have found out for myself, who knew
precisely the kind of help a stranger needs,
and gave it as freely as if he had not had a
thousand more important things to live for.
Thus I never felt safer or cosier at anybody's
fireside, even my own, than at the
dinner-table of the Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>Out of this serene sky came a thunderbolt.
His Lordship got up and proceeded
to make some very eulogistic remarks upon
"the literary and commercial"&mdash;I question
whether those two adjectives were
ever before married by a copulative conjunction,
and they certainly would not live
together in illicit intercourse, of their own
accord&mdash;"the literary and commercial attainments
of an eminent gentleman there
present," and then went on to speak of
the relations of blood and interest between
Great Britain and the aforesaid eminent
gentleman's native country. Those bonds
were more intimate than had ever before
existed between two great nations, throughout
all history, and his Lordship felt assured
that that whole honorable company
would join him in the expression of a fervent
wish that they might be held inviolably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
sacred, on both sides of the Atlantic,
now and forever. Then came the same
wearisome old toast, dry and hard to chew
upon as a musty sea-biscuit, which had been
the text of nearly all the oratory of my
public career. The herald sonorously announced
that Mr. So-and-so would now respond
to his Right Honorable Lordship's
toast and speech, the trumpets sounded the
customary flourish for the onset, there was
a thunderous rumble of anticipatory applause,
and finally a deep silence sank upon
the festive hall.</p>

<p>All this was a horrid piece of treachery
on the Lord Mayor's part, after beguiling
me within his lines on a pledge of safe-conduct;
and it seemed very strange that he
could not let an unobtrusive individual eat
his dinner in peace, drink a small sample
of the Mansion House wine, and go away
grateful at heart for the old English hospitality.
If his Lordship had sent me an
infusion of ratsbane in the loving-cup, I
should have taken it much more kindly at
his hands. But I suppose the secret of the
matter to have been somewhat as follows.</p>

<p>All England, just then, was in one of
those singular fits of panic excitement (not
fear, though as sensitive and tremulous as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
that emotion), which, in consequence of
the homogeneous character of the people,
their intense patriotism, and their dependence
for their ideas in public affairs on
other sources than their own examination
and individual thought, are more sudden,
pervasive, and unreasoning than any similar
mood of our own public. In truth, I
have never seen the American public in a
state at all similar, and believe that we are
incapable of it. Our excitements are not
impulsive, like theirs, but, right or wrong,
are moral and intellectual. For example,
the grand rising of the North, at the commencement
of this war, bore the aspect
of impulse and passion only because it was
so universal, and necessarily done in a moment,
just as the quiet and simultaneous
getting-up of a thousand people out of
their chairs would cause a tumult that
might be mistaken for a storm. We were
cool then, and have been cool ever since,
and shall remain cool to the end, which
we shall take coolly, whatever it may be.
There is nothing which the English find it
so difficult to understand in us as this characteristic.
They imagine us, in our collective
capacity, a kind of wild beast, whose
normal condition is savage fury, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
always looking for the moment when we
shall break through the slender barriers of
international law and comity, and compel
the reasonable part of the world, with themselves
at the head, to combine for the purpose
of putting us into a stronger cage.
At times this apprehension becomes so
powerful (and when one man feels it, a
million do) that it resembles the passage of
the wind over a broad field of grain, where
you see the whole crop bending and swaying
beneath one impulse, and each separate
stalk tossing with the self-same disturbance
as its myriad companions. At
such periods all Englishmen talk with a
terrible identity of sentiment and expression.
You have the whole country in
each man; and not one of them all, if you
put him strictly to the question, can give a
reasonable ground for his alarm. There
are but two nations in the world&mdash;our
own country and France&mdash;that can put
England into this singular state. It is the
united sensitiveness of a people extremely
well-to-do, careful of their country's honor,
most anxious for the preservation of the
cumbrous and moss-grown prosperity which
they have been so long in consolidating,
and incompetent (owing to the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
half-sightedness, and their habit of trusting
to a few leading minds for their public
opinion) to judge when that prosperity is
really threatened.</p>

<p>If the English were accustomed to look
at the foreign side of any international
dispute, they might easily have satisfied
themselves that there was very little
danger of a war at that particular crisis,
from the simple circumstance that their
own Government had positively not an
inch of honest ground to stand upon, and
could not fail to be aware of the fact.
Neither could they have met Parliament
with any show of a justification for incurring
war. It was no such perilous juncture
as exists now, when law and right are
really controverted on sustainable or plausible
grounds, and a naval commander may
at any moment fire off the first cannon of
a terrible contest. If I remember it correctly,
it was a mere diplomatic squabble,
in which the British ministers, with the
politic generosity which they are in the
habit of showing towards their official subordinates,
had tried to browbeat us for the
purpose of sustaining an ambassador in an
indefensible proceeding; and the American
Government (for God had not denied us an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
administration of statesmen then) had retaliated
with stanch courage and exquisite
skill, putting inevitably a cruel mortification
upon their opponents, but indulging
them with no pretense whatever for active
resentment.</p>

<p>Now the Lord Mayor, like any other
Englishman, probably fancied that War
was on the western gale, and was glad to
lay hold of even so insignificant an American
as myself, who might be made to harp
on the rusty old strings of national sympathies,
identity of blood and interest, and
community of language and literature, and
whisper peace where there was no peace,
in however weak an utterance. And possibly
his Lordship thought, in his wisdom,
that the good feeling which was sure to be
expressed by a company of well-bred Englishmen,
at his august and far-famed dinner-table,
might have an appreciable influence
on the grand result. Thus, when the Lord
Mayor invited me to his feast, it was a
piece of strategy. He wanted to induce
me to fling myself, like a lesser Curtius,
with a larger object of self-sacrifice, into
the chasm of discord between England and
America, and, on my ignominious demur,
had resolved to shove me in with his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
right-honorable hands, in the hope of closing
up the horrible pit forever. On the
whole, I forgive his Lordship. He meant
well by all parties,&mdash;himself, who would
share the glory, and me, who ought to have
desired nothing better than such an heroic
opportunity,&mdash;his own country, which
would continue to get cotton and bread-stuffs,
and mine, which would get everything
that men work with and wear.</p>

<p>As soon as the Lord Mayor began to
speak, I rapped upon my mind, and it
gave forth a hollow sound, being absolutely
empty of appropriate ideas. I never
thought of listening to the speech, because
I knew it all beforehand in twenty repetitions
from other lips, and was aware that it
would not offer a single suggestive point.
In this dilemma, I turned to one of my
three friends, a gentleman whom I knew
to possess an enviable flow of silver speech,
and obtested him, by whatever he deemed
holiest, to give me at least an available
thought or two to start with, and, once
afloat, I would trust my guardian-angel for
enabling me to flounder ashore again. He
advised me to begin with some remarks
complimentary to the Lord Mayor, and
expressive of the hereditary reverence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
which his office was held,&mdash;at least, my
friend thought that there would be no
harm in giving his Lordship this little
sugar-plum, whether quite the fact or no,&mdash;was
held by the descendants of the Puritan
forefathers. Thence, if I liked, getting
flexible with the oil of my own eloquence,
I might easily slide off into the momentous
subject of the relations between England
and America, to which his Lordship had
made such weighty allusion.</p>

<p>Seizing this handful of straw with a
death-grip, and bidding my three friends
bury me honorably, I got upon my legs to
save both countries, or perish in the attempt.
The tables roared and thundered
at me, and suddenly were silent again.
But, as I have never happened to stand in
a position of greater dignity and peril, I
deem it a stratagem of sage policy here to
close these Sketches, leaving myself still
erect in so heroic an attitude.</p>

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project

copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
